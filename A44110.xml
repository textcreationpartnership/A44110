            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>AN ANSWER to a ſmall Treatiſe, CALL'D <hi>Juſt Meaſures, in an EPISTLE of Peace and Love,</hi> &amp;c.</head>
            <p>WE have conſidered this Epiſtle, ſtil'd, <hi>Juſt Meaſures,</hi> &amp;c. Subſcribed <hi>G. P.</hi> Directed to all Diſſatisfied among Friends, as well to ſuch asarenot ſeperated, as to ſuch asare; Now though we are in no actual Seperation, yet being truly Diſſatisfied, takes occaſion to Write as followeth. Who's the Author, is not ſo much as what is ſaid, conſidering it ſeems approved by the Elderſhip, being ſent abroad amongſt the Society, as ſuch Books are, as are allowed for Orthodox, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in ſpeaking to it, we ſhall direct our ſelves to them, not doubting, but as it was Wrote for them, their mind's included; and unto whom can we ſo well apply our ſelves for Relief as unto ſuch as have been the Occaſion of our Trouble, by bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing into the Society againſt the Minds of their Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, things for which there appears no neceſſity, and then requiring compliance under the Notion of
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:98376:3"/>Elderſhip; now if we apply our ſelves to them, then chiefly to ſuch as ſeems to be as the Head, and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting Cauſes by their Effects, this ſeems ſetled at <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,</hi> from hence came our Circular Letters that have diſturbed Us. And therefore as things are Model<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from hence muſt come our Voice of Peace if ever Our Diviſions be cemented, or our Diſatsfaction re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved; but by the way pray let Us know how this headſhip, as to Government, came to be fixed here, to Us in our Caſe there ſeems but two wayes, that is either by the choiſe of the People, or by the Choice of the Elderſhip, Now if the Society as ſuch have devolved the Government upon you that reſide here: Pray when was this Agreement made, for 'tis needful to know at leaſt the Original of this Conſtitution, if we are to be concluded by it? But if this Headſhip be fixed here by the choice of the Elderſhip, Pray then give Us leave to Capitulate for that Juſt Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty we had in the Society, before thoſe things was run to this height of Diſatisfaction, as formally be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing made terms of Communion, whileſt We have not gone from Ancient Principles, nor into any thing that is Immoral or evil; if you deny Us this, We muſt complain 'tis not Government, but ſomething of Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranny or Injuſtice at leaſt that is introduced.</p>
            <p>That the Headſhip as to Government is ſetled here appears further by the Power being lodged here, for the conveneing of Our Yearly Meetings, as well as by their Aſſembling here, 'tis here our Orders have their ſtrength, by the Approbation of this confluence. You know Chriſt Our Lord tells us that <hi>His King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom is not of this World,</hi> and therefore we conceive His Government is not ſet up by ſuch wayes and means as uphold Worldly Power, (addreſs to <hi>Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants</hi>
               <pb n="5" facs="tcp:98376:3"/>Page 232 to 244) if ſo, we cannot think this is Chriſts Government, nor like it, which is ſo like that of the World, both for Contrivance and Order, and if not his, it ought at beſt to be Subſervient to his; on which account You ought to be Cautious that you intrench not upon his Prerogative, who is Lord of Conſcience; in ſhort, the Government con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended for by you, you muſt own to be our Lords or yours; Our Lords it can not be, for 'tis certain he uſes no other force to uphold his Government, then to ſet it up, and if he alwayes took it by Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience and Suffering, he will never uphold it by force and Violence (addreſs to <hi>Proteſtants</hi> 203 Page to the end of that Head) and therefore when any thing of Violence is uſed, we may be ſure it is none of his, and if not his, then it muſt be yours, and as yours, you ought not to impoſe new things, for that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroys that freedom we ought to have and injoy as we are a Free and Voluntary Society; but you tell us this <hi>belongs to the outpart of the Church as we are a Civil Society.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>What's this but to ſay we may have one ſort of Power to Govern the out Part, and another to guide the in; this makes way for Carnal and Unregenerate Men (if they have but a good ſhare of natural parts) to be our Rulers, but you know Chriſt our Lord tells us, <hi>if the Inſide be clean, the outſide will be clean alſo,</hi> and truly all Conformity that wants Convicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on or Perſwaſion can have no acceptance with God, ſo that all this is but to pleaſe Men; but if you will in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt that thoſe things are Civil, however you may then take away as well as add, and to take away thoſe things ſo far as they have given occaſion, cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly ſeems needful; otherwiſe you may tranſmit
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:98376:4"/>your errours to Poſterity, for 'tis on thoſe Founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions you lay for Government, that ſome others will build, and conſidering that all Builders on a Religious ſcore, ſince the Apoſtaſie, have fail'd at leaſt in your judgment; or elſe how could you have Juſtified our diſſent; on this account you ought to have been the more cautious; for error in the beginning, either in the matter or manner of bringing in things, muſt be the Ruin of a Chriſtian Superſtructure; ſo that tho the Foundation may have been good you may have profeſſed, yet Hay and Stubble may be Builded, for when you tell us <hi>thoſe are the leſſer things about which the Difference is,</hi> (Page 16) they cannot be Fundamentals, and when you ſay <hi>they concern not God. Faith, Conſcience or Religion</hi> (Page 4 and 5.) they can be but your Opinions and Judgements; thoſe can have no higher Original then that of Mans reaſon, which as it is ſubject to be ſhort, vary, and miſcar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, ſuch things as thoſe ought not to have been brought in as the Lawes of the <hi>Medes</hi> and <hi>Perſians;</hi> but Cautiouſly and by way of Probation. Therefore having now the proofe of the evil conſequence of being Poſſitive, where at moſt you ought but to have recommended: You would do well to Repeal, or at leaſt ſuſpend next Meeting what has been found ſo fatal to the Unity deſired, otherwiſe you may ſhew more Power to Rule, then prudence to Govern.</p>
            <p>What you have ſaid to others in Addreſs to <hi>Proteſtants</hi> (page 62 to 92) both what ſhould be made Terms of Communion, and what ſhould not, deſerves your moſt ſerious Conſideration; for cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly we want nothing of what (you ſay there) is ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient for Communion, and if ſo it is unreaſonable to
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:98376:4"/>ſhut us out for want of that which ought not to be made ſuch, and that in your own ſenſe, pray be conſiſtent for that paſſage in <hi>Page</hi> 93 deſerves not only your Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration but Application, <hi>and that is if we conſider the matter well, I fear</hi> (ſayes our Author) <hi>it will be found that the occaſion of diſturbance in the Church of Chriſt, hath in moſt Ages been found to lie on the ſide of thoſe that had the greateſt ſway in it, which in our Age is but too true.</hi> We obſerve this <hi>Epiſtle</hi> dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers much from other Books writ on this Subject, and allowed by the ſame Authority, if we ſhould Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>front this with them they would be like <hi>Babel</hi> Indeed, whileſt the ſame thing is pretended, 'tis true we are wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to ſearch to the quick, but as we would not make the breach wider then needs muſt, we ſhall not at this time compare them together, hoping how e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver that the ſoftneſs of the Stile of this beſpeaks a diſlike at leaſt of former ſeverities; what is right we are willing to acknowledge, and ſhall as readily note; What is wrong, concluding it is dangerous to endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to heal our hurt ſlightly; and how ever our en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour may ſucceed or be reſented; we can in our Defence ſay, that not only our Arms but our Hearts are open and free to receive you, and what you ſay as we meet it in the truth and you in the Spirit and power of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, and can add ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerely, that our deſire to ſeek and find that ſeemleſs Garment of Our Lord you ſpeak of and not only find it but that we might have it put on as in our beginning, whileſt Travellers together in Spirit for the true Reſt, which ſo many have ſet out to find but miſcarryed; but as this Seamleſs Garment ſtands not in Identity of an Opinion, nor in the Unity of thoſe Formallities of Form, which reſpect more the
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:98376:5"/>manner of doing of a thing then the thing it ſelfe; therefore all the Builders that have ſought it here have erred and will ſtill err, as they thus ſeek it. For as Truth is contrary to Error, ſo is Gods way to Mans in this matter, as our own Appollogies for Liberty do abundantly ſhew; Now if the Unity to be ſought for ſtand not in Opinion nor in thoſe Formallities of Form as above, it can only be found in the Spirit, where there is a ſincerity to God; this Our Lord owns when ever 'tis according to the degree of Light af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forded. And that is it which ſhould be ſeriouſly en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired after, and this you can hardly deny Us, upon your own Conceſſions in this <hi>Epiſtle,</hi> if you are real, other if you deceive Us. You confeſs (<hi>Page</hi> the 2) that <hi>we are one with you in Judgement in the Worſhip and Doctrine of Truth,</hi> &amp;c. Now if by <hi>Worſhip</hi> you mean a true ſerving of God, and if by <hi>Doctrine of Truth</hi> you intend, as you ought, what concerns God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs, it can hardly be but you muſt allow. Us found in the Faith, and Conſcientious in what we doe; for 'tis impoſſible we ſhould be faithful in the greater Things, and falſe in the leſs, on this account you ought to allow our reaſon or indulge us; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore conſidering this, and ſeveral other confeſſions in this Book, may we not hope for the future, that Diſſenters and ſuch as are diſſatisfied may meet with a more favourable aſpect from you, and not only their ſeperate Meetings Viſited in Love by you, but your Meetings free and open in your minds and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haviour to ſuch as come in Love and good will to Viſit You, tho in ſome things diſatisfied with your proceedings; for what can keep up the Difference more then your ſtrangeneſs, and how can it tend to accommodation, the Thing you pretend to deſire
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:98376:5"/>and ſeek? Or how can it be Truth, or like it, to keep up this Difference and diſtance to Severities? if not ſome time to rudeneſs; and that with ſuch as agree with you, in your own ſenſe, in all the Eſſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als of Religion, and truly ſerve God for any thing you know or can prove to the contrary, Pray con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider of it.</p>
            <p>But to proceed; You ſpeak of the Government to remain in the hands of the Elderſhip, but if Our Lord makes this Elderſhip, does he not alſo make the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion that's neceſſary, for we will ſay we are for good Order, and if the Elders ſet us a good exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of humility and ſelfe-denyal, by which we find it is not themſelves they Preach, but Chriſt and his Government they deſire ſhould be ſet up, and not their own: We can readily give them double Honour, by following them as they follow Chriſt; and we are ſure none of you ought to deſire more.</p>
            <p>Now if We are only to follow you, as you are the followers of Chriſt, we ought to be ſenſible of it, and that muſt be either by an outward Rule, or by an inward; if the firſt, ſet it forth; if the latter, ſtay till we are convinced or perſwaded, this is fair, here blind Obedience is excluded, and it ought not to be denyed; on this foot we inquire how we muſt know this Elderſhip on whoſe Conduct we may ſafely rely; for where there muſt be a dependance, there ought to be a certainty; pray mind that, to us then as a free and voluntary Society, there ſeems but two wayes to know Elderſhip, that is chiefly after the Spirit, or after the fleſh, that is, after an inward or an outward way; now if we muſt know our Elderſhip after the Spirit, then indeed no matter of your ſetting them forth, for as we are not to believe every Spirit, a liberty
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:98376:6"/>of Examination is reſerv'd, and where that ought to be, a choice muſt be allowed, on this Foot it follows beyond contradiction, we are not Obliged to new things but as convinced or perſwaded; and as this is according to Gods dealing with us in our Spiritual travel, ſo it agrees with our Imbodying as a free and voluntary Society; and grant but this great Truth and Ancient Teſtimony, and as it may prevent further diſatisfaction, which to us ſeems greater then you either know or are willing to grant, ſo it may alſo help to cure our Diviſion; and how you ſhould deny this to ſuch as was of the Communitie, till your Excluſion by Impoſing your Opinions, and do ſtill agree with you in the Worſhip and Doctrine of Truth we can not tell; but if you will ſay that we are to know our El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders chiefly after the fleſh, that is after an outward way; I Anſwer. Not now to inſiſt on the weakneſs and inſufficiency of this way, we do ſay then as we are a free and voluntary Society, it is needful, as well as our right, not only to be ſatisfied in them, but have our choice of them; and then not only know who they are but where they reſide, that as on the one hand on occaſion we may have recourſe unto them, ſo on the other, that thereby we may be ſecured from being Impoſed upon by pretenders.</p>
            <p>But if you deny the firſt, and cannot ſecure Us in the latter; as we have neither choice in the Elderſhip, nor power to refuſe what is wrong, there is no way left to prevent Ignorance and ſlavery; at this door, that thing you call Prieſt-craft entered, and that di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinction of <hi>Clargy</hi> and <hi>Laity,</hi> which muſt be wrong and inſupportable in you, what ever it is in others, we in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat you to conſider of it in a cool Mind.</p>
            <p>But if you will ſay (as in this <hi>Epiſtle</hi> Page 14.) that
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:98376:6"/>
               <hi>the Government muſt remain in the hands of ſuch as God hath made Eminent in the gathering of his People,</hi> or to this effect; then we Anſwer, as the caſe ſtands, as ſpecious as this is, it is not like to cure our Diviſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, but rather to increaſe them, this being a way to make as many Parties as ſuch Perſons to head them, ſome for <hi>Paul</hi> ſome for <hi>Apollo,</hi> &amp;c. For 'tis ſure under this Notion there is and have been many Elders amongſt ſuch as are disſatisfied who may on this foot plead an Equal right to Govern; what then remains this way except you'l fly to that of Antiquity or Number, but as thoſe have been denyed by you to others, we conclude you ſhould not uſe it; then what's to be done to cure our Diviſions and prevent further Diſatisfaction? nothing can do but our Elders <gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="1 word">

               </gap> to throw down their Crowns at the feet of Jeſus, that it may appear to be his Government and not their's that's ſought. Thus Chriſt our Lord adviſed in the caſe of Difference and conteſt, <hi>the Elder is to be as the Younger, and him that Rules, as be that ſerves, and he that will be the greateſt, is to manifeſt it by being Servant to the reſt;</hi> for 'tis cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain the Government of Chriſt our Lord in this caſe is Uniform and does not vary (tho Mans may) uſing no other way to preſerve then he did to gather, for if force, ſtrife, contention, or violence were right at any time, he could as well uſe it at firſt as at laſt. But as he always made his enterance by Patience and Suffering in his Servants, as well as in himſelf, it is certain he rules in humility overcoming difference by the ſame way; it is true in the breaking forth of his power, his Servants are moſtly Humble and Patiens of neceſſity, becauſe they have nothing to depend on but him; here many have been preſerved that have fail'd when they have known any thing of an
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:98376:7"/>overcoming, as tho the Lord was changed becauſe the ſtate of things had changed them; No he is the ſame ſtill, and therefore no other way but to deny ſelf, and to throw down your Crowns at the feet of Jeſus; an hard thing indeed to fleſh and blood, but that's no matter, <hi>fleſh and blood cannot inherit the Kingdom of God,</hi> and as this was never known truly done in any Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation, ſo it has certainly been the ground of Diviſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, or at leaſt a cauſe of it, and of that enmity that hath attended Seperation; and 'tis now become your Tryal; O that you could conſider of it that ſo the evil and enmity at leaſt in our different apprehenſion and diſſatisfaction might be avoided; pray conſider, more light may ſpring up, as it hath done before, and God may make uſe of whom he pleaſes without your leave, and you ought rather to wait for his judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, then to conclude you are Judges of it, or of whom he ſends or makes uſe of; verily you cannot be too litle in your own eyes, what ever you are in others, pray direct all to Chriſt, that he may be known by way of preheminence in all, the Elder of Elders, and be content to leave all with him, as in the beginning, with out ſetting limits to his appearance, of your own deviſing, knowing moſt certainly that none that come truly to him, can do any thing againſt the Truth, and they that do not ſo come can do nothing for it; and once for all, tho what is evil and Immoral may and ought to be rejected, yet conſidering what gives ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptance with God can not be Impoſed, let not a miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led Zeal, <hi>on this ſpecious Pretence, to make the Church as large as the Profeſſion, or by adding of new Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders and Rules, under pretence to help ſuch as are not fatihful,</hi> be a cauſe to reject ſuch as are; for as you deal with ſuch as are Conſcientious, you will
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:98376:7" rendition="simple:additions"/>be dealt with; and to be plain with you, if in this caſe you do not Judge your ſelves, you will be Judged by ſome that ſucceed, as truly as you have judged ſome that did go before; for if you would but honeſtly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flect upon your ſelves in that glaſs of equal Liberty, which you have held to others, <hi>you might certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſee ſome thing of the ſame Image, that you have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved in others.</hi> And why ſhould you take this ill or think it hard or ſtrange, for you muſt come through thoſe Difficulties and Straits, where others have fail'd or you muſt miſcarry; but if you have not ſeen them it is certain you have not eſcaped them; then muſt you be as truly tryed, (as others have been) by them whom the Lord may ſend; you know what our Lord ſaid, <hi>There are firſt that ſhall be laſt, and there are laſt that ſhall be firſt.</hi> You know thoſe hired into the Vineyard <hi>ſome came ſooner then others, but thoſe that came laſt he paid firſt,</hi> this was not faulted whileſt thoſe that came firſt, did ſtill expect to receive according to their Eſtimate of their time and Service (as they ſaid) <hi>in the beat of the day,</hi> but when it proved otherwiſe, all was wrong with them, what was written, was <hi>writ for our Learning;</hi> therefore ſet Self but really aſide; and the Scripture will be found as true in our day as formerly. For to be plain, 'tis the overvaluing of your ſelves and the work, that makes the miſtake, but as I ſhould ſpeak to the intelligent, on this point ſhall not much further proceed at this time, but take notice, what is here ſaid, is not to depreſs any beneath their true vallue or raiſe any above it in the eyes of others, but only that confidence in the fleſh, wherein ſo many have ſtuck and miſcarried, might be waſted and conſumed, that ſo the Lord our God might be exalted over all, <hi>for he that is come, is yet to come,
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:98376:8"/>and as His goings forth hath been from Everlaſting, they ſtill continue a Riddle to the Rulers, and a Miſtery to all that is but born after the fleſh;</hi> and what is <hi>fleſh</hi> in a Religious ſenſe, but Form, the external part of Religion; for all that ſtick here, as they are great in the formality of it, ſo ſuch never fail'd to perſecute them thats <hi>born after the Spirit,</hi> becauſe ſuch being dead with Chriſt to the World, and the Rudiments of it, have not nor never had that value for <hi>out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward things,</hi> which thoſe <hi>born after the fleſh</hi> have; yet <hi>alwayes brings forth the righteouſneſs of thoſe things.</hi> It was thus betwixt <hi>Iſrael</hi> and the Prophets, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the <hi>Jewiſh Rabbys</hi> and our Lord, and hath been much after the ſame manner in the Reformation, and is after the like ſort now, if you could but conſider it; but for all this we can allow of Elders, and that in a good ſenſe, for ſome have been before others in teſtifying to Gods appearance in our day, and have been made inſtrumental to turn ſome to righteouſneſs in the hand of the Lord; but what then, did ſuch find out the Truth by their skill or cunning, or the Lord fought them out, did ſuch ſend themſelves or the Lord ſent ſuch into his Vineyard? If the Lord, is not all owing to him? and cannot you be content with what honour he gives, without ſeeking honour by bearing witneſs of your ſelves, for the noiſe you make bears witneſs you are not ſatisfied with that ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour he gives, <hi>he that hath the Bride is the Bridegroom</hi> and in the beſt ſenſe you can be but Preparers for him, and as you have directed all to him you ought to be willing to preſent all to him, <hi>for his increaſing muſt be the decreaſing of the Inſtrument;</hi> for every true Preparer for Chriſt does certainly know as he comes to take the Government they muſt decreaſe, therefore
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:98376:8"/>do they conſtantly throw down their Crowns by affirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that their Service muſt be fulfilled to every one that comes to know the ſufficiency of our Lords Government. And cannot you be glad and rejoyce in this? If not, all is not right yet; for all the true Preparers for him, as they know this, ought to be ſo, they both ſeek and defire it, but ſuch as are ſo much in the formallitys of Form, they cannot, becauſe they gather to themſelves that is to <hi>their own Opinions and Judgments;</hi> grant that you have Preached to us Spiritual things; What then, do you deſire we ſhould know you after the fleſh for that? If ſo, all is not yet right; if God have made ſome of you Inſtrumental to turn ſome to Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and in that ſenſe may be termed as Fathers, do you expect our Obedience as Children? But if ſo, conſider you are under as great or greater Oligation to us as Children, you ſhould neither provoke not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire of us what we can not give for Conſcience ſake; for it would be cruel to ſeek to deſtroy what you might be Inſtrumental to beget; 'tis not a telling of us the cauſe of Difference is not matter of Conſcience whileſt we know, and do moſt ſurely believe other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe; beware what you do for if by your diſtinctious of what's Civil and Religious, you deſtroy the tender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Conſcience or reject ſuch as are Conſciencious, your Work muſt ſuffer loſs by the fire, which muſt try your Works as well as others, and indeed it ſeems already kindled, the occaſion of all this noiſe is for the ſaving of what is combuſtible; whereas had you builded nothing but Gold and Silver, had you in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiſted upon nothing but what had been Eſſentiall to Society and good Order, there would have been no occaſion of this noiſe; becauſe then there had been no fear or hazzard of loſs; nay ſuch things would have

For this fairly demonſtrates, thoſe did not Seperate to be at liberty in the fleſh, as has been too commonly reported and objected; no, no, that was not the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; Places for Worſhip ſhew ſuch intend to ſerve God ſtill, and Diſcipline denotes ſuch intend ſtill to take care of what buſineſs belongs to the Society; this we think might bring you nearer them then you are, if well conſidered, what you confeſs, <gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="1 word">

            <p>

But this a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove being as the Original or firſt beginning of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent Diſſatisfaction, <hi>that and the reſt may be included;</hi> in the ſucceſs of this, we may grant the Objection is bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter made then anſwered a great deal, but yet it is neither fairly nor truly ſtated at leaſt in the firſt part; for you ma<gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="1+ letters">

            <p>As to the latter part of the Objection 'tis more fair; we may take it beginning at thoſe words, <hi>at leaſt no neceſſity for either,</hi> that is, there is no <hi>neceſſity</hi> for <hi>Women</hi> Conſtant <hi>Meeting</hi> either by themſelves or with the Men for Government in our Church or So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety.

            <p>Now we do moſt ſurely believe you can prove <hi>neither</hi> of the Points above, and might here give ſome reaſons for it, without taking any further no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of what you write; but leaſt you or any ſhould ſay we evade your Arguments becauſe we cannot Anſwer them, we will conſider them firſt; though truly they ſeem in our Judgment ſo far from proving any thing to the matter, that they appear more <hi>Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficial</hi> then <hi>Genuine,</hi> more like <hi>drawing a Curtain</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the <hi>work of Imagerie,</hi> then fairly ſetting out the truth; or like ſuch as have bad Cauſes of Titles to manage; nothing is more dangerous then comming to the <hi>Merrit of the Cauſe,</hi> or truth in the matter, for what a good Cauſe in this caſe indeavours <hi>in plainneſs and ſimplicitie,</hi> the other endeavours to avo<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">

Since it has been and is moſt ſincerely declared by the Brethren chiefly concern'd in the good Order and Service of the Church, that they have no thought or deſign of impoſing any thing upon the Conſciences of Friends or that friends, ought to have now any more then at the beginning any other reaſon or meaſure of compliance or conformity in matters re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating to God then the conviction of the light and Spirit of God in every Conſcience but there is this diſtinction to be conſidered well of, that the matters in difference are not ſuch as require ſuch an exerciſe and conviction of Conſcience as is pleaded becauſe they relate not to Faith or Worſhip, did they require Faith, or did they appertain to Worſhip, as if you were obliged to Worſhip God only in ſuch Place, time, Geſture, Raiment, with ſuch words and Forms of ſpeech,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Your Plea and objection were good; but this about which your Diſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction ariſes is merely Diſcipline in Government and not in Worſhip, Formallitie in Order, not in Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, it is about Methods of regulating our ſelves as to the Civil or outpart of the Church, as we are a So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>For inſtance, to keep the Neceſſitous, and reconcile Differences,</hi> in fine, <hi>to prevent rebuke, and reſtore diſorderly Walkers.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſ.</hi> You ſee we have quoted you fairly, and ſhall as freely examine it without begging any excuſe; for in matters of <hi>Truth and Juſtice</hi> all carnal conſideration is to be ſet aſide; on this account then we are to
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:98376:12"/>know no Man after the fleſh, no not that of <hi>Fathers or Elders,</hi> and therefore firſt take notice, all this has no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in it to prove <hi>a neceſſity for Womens Meeting</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly in the Society as above, nor that you under the Notion of Elders have any Power from God or the So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety to bring in, and inforce upon Us that for which in truth there is no neceſſity; no, could you do that, you do but trifle and loſe time by this diſcourſe; but the truth of it is, this beſpeaks you can prove neither of the Points; for you perſwade us to follow you in thoſe things, not becauſe there is a neceſſity for them, or becauſe you have Power to Impoſe them upon us; but becauſe they are not <hi>matter of Conſcience;</hi> whereas if you had <hi>Power</hi> to bring them in or there was <hi>a neceſſity</hi> for them, then they muſt be <hi>matter of Conſcience,</hi> and it would be our Duty to obey you; <hi>for what is Duty is matter of Conſcience;</hi> you know we have been directed and exhorted <hi>to walk in the light as God is in the light,</hi> and that is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes, but this we cannot do without <hi>Conſcience</hi> and <hi>underſtanding;</hi> now if we muſt follow you without <hi>underſtanding</hi> and <hi>Conſcience,</hi> we are to follow you <hi>not in the Light but without it,</hi> and then that muſt be in the dark, and you know 'tis writ <hi>they that walk in the dark know not whither they go;</hi> to be ſure <hi>if they get not into the Ditch they muſt be in danger of it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But to proceed, You tell us that <hi>you find no cauſe for us to fear in the general an infringement of your Chriſtian Liberty,</hi> &amp;c. If this was true in the <hi>general,</hi> yet juſt cauſe <hi>in a particular caſe</hi> was ſufficient for our reſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, <hi>for once admit of one error, and way is made for more;</hi> you know 'tis a Proverb, <hi>Rome was not built on a day;</hi> nor did the moſt degenerate <hi>Church</hi> become ſo all at once; nay there's a time ordinarily to grow
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:98376:13"/>worſe as well as better, but your reaſon as we take it, that <hi>we need not fear an Infringement on our Chriſtian Liberty</hi> is this, that <hi>the Brethren chiefly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned in the good Order,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>have moſt ſincerely de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared they have no thoughts of impoſing upon Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience.</hi> But pray who are thoſe Brethren, what muſt we ſuppoſe at adventure who they are, and then conclude they have not only <hi>moſt ſincerely declar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed</hi> as above, but alſo that they <hi>cannot err or be miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken?</hi> But in the firſt Place, if the matter be ſo purely <hi>Civil</hi> as you make it, why are not <hi>thoſe perſons</hi> you ſpeak of, as civilly ſet forth, for otherwiſe we are to depend on <hi>we know not whom,</hi> and take for truth what we cannot underſtand, and what more <hi>blind</hi> and <hi>Implicite?</hi> And what other Medium is afforded whileſt neither the Brethren are ſet out, nor we al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed <hi>Conſcience to know what men ſay is true,</hi> for take notice, <hi>there muſt be a certainty of thoſe things, or a liberty of Choice.</hi> But our Author is one of thoſe chiefly concern'd in <hi>the good Order,</hi> above or he is not, if not pray how does he know thoſe he ſpeaks of have <hi>moſt ſincerely declared?</hi> what does he preſume they have, and we muſt truſt him; and what's this but preſumption upon preſumption? But if he is one of them <hi>chiefly concern'd</hi> and ſo may pretend he ſpeaks by experience; what demonſtration does he give be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond his <hi>ſay ſo?</hi> but if we know him and could take his word for himſelf, what ſecurity can he give for the <hi>reſt concerned,</hi> that they have <hi>moſt ſincerely declared</hi> as before; but ſuppoſe they are ſincere and in ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt, what ſatisfaction can either he or they give that they are not <hi>miſtaken</hi> in the matter? this is neither <hi>Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertinent</hi> nor <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nneceſſary;</hi> for if we muſt be led without <hi>underſtanding and Conſcience,</hi> to know the
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:98376:13"/>truth of things or be ſatisfied for our ſelves, we had need to have ſome ſatisfaction <hi>of the ſufficiency of thoſe on whom we are to depend,</hi> for <hi>what blind Man would be willing to be led into a ditch?</hi> ſo that tho he cannot ſee himſelfe, yet would be as ſure as poſſible thoſe can, on whom he is to <hi>depend,</hi> and plainly whilſt you neither ſet forth our <hi>Leaders</hi> that we may query them for our ſatisfaction, nor allow us <hi>Conſcience</hi> to know what Men ſay is true; you put us as much as in you lyes into a worſe condition then thoſe that's blind, <hi>who yet have liberty to chuſe for their ſatisfaction to the beſt of their un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding;</hi> how can you think much that we deſire to be ſatisfied when the Leaders and Elders in moſt Ages in your own ſenſe, at one time or other <hi>have been miſtaken,</hi> and by their miſtake have cauſed the People to err, and yet might be ſincere or in earneſt; for you know the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> bare the <hi>Jews</hi> witneſs, <hi>they had a Zeal for God but not according to knowledge, and therefore being Ignorant of the Righteouſneſs of God, went about to eſtabliſh their own;</hi> and if we conſider there's nothing new what was then, hath been in all the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation &amp; is ſtill, and will continue, where <hi>outward things are over valued, or Circumſtantial things made terms of Communion.</hi> So that there is no more ſaid or done in all this, then what miſtaken Men and degenerate Churches may have ſaid or done.</p>
            <p>But to Proceed, you tell us <hi>that Friends ought not to have now any more then at the beginning, any other reaſon or meaſure of compliance or conformitie in matters relating to God, then the conviction of the light, and Spirit of Chriſt in every Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>But</hi> (ſay you) <hi>there is this diſtinction to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered well of, that the matters in difference are not ſuch as re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire ſuch an exerciſe and conviction as is pleaded, becauſe they relate not to Faith or Worſhip,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſwer,</hi> We grant that a diſtinction may be made be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt <hi>what relates to God, and what relates to Man,</hi> but to make
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:98376:14"/>this diſtinction in our caſe, on purpoſe to exclude <hi>Conſcience</hi> in the latter, is ſo far from being <hi>a right meaſure,</hi> that it is really wrong, and not only wrong but dangerous on a Religious ſcore, and not ſafe on a Civil. Firſt on a Religious ſcore, as this diſtinction makes ſerving God not to ſtand in all we do, it makes it but to ſtand in ſome things, and as this makes Gods Worſhip and Service not to be conſtant and continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al, it makes Worſhip only to relate to times and Places; in the beſt ſenſe this can but comport with a Legal Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice and diſpenſation, for it cannot agree with what's truly <hi>Goſpel</hi> as rightly diſtinguiſhed and underſtood from what is <hi>Legal,</hi> for ſpeaking generally there is nor never was but two <hi>Covenants</hi> or <hi>States</hi> in which men are truly and ſenſibly tyed to God, the firſt is <hi>that</hi> of fear, the other is <hi>that</hi> of Love; the firſt is <hi>that</hi> of a Servant, and is a Glorious State and has many advantages, but as it cannot perfect, it is not to continue, but is to give Place to the <hi>latter,</hi> this is <hi>that</hi> which as it is perfect ſo 'tis everlaſting, the firſt ſtate can ſpeak much of his Maſters greatneſs and Majeſtie in the manifeſting of his Royal Pleaſure at ſundry times and on diſtinct Occaſions; but as thoſe appearances continue not, ſo this State is but a Servants, and doth not abide always in the houſe, therefore does not equally ſerve God at all times, but the Son's ſtate abides allwayes in the Houſe, and does allwayes what's pleaſing in the ſight of God, and does not ſerve him more at one time then another, as it relates to his Obedience; for tho' the Errand, he is ſent about, may differ according to the Occaſion; yet cannot be ſaid to ſerve God more at one time then another becauſe <hi>his Love and Obedience is equal.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now to apply it: For you under the Notion of Elders to conceive, believe and teach as above, <hi>that Gods Worſhip, Honour and Service, ſtands but in ſome Acts, and but at ſome Times and Places,</hi> as it muſt, if we do not ſerve God in things
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:98376:14"/>that may be termed Civil; tis true this ſets up an Elder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip by begetting <hi>an Implicite</hi> reverance to them; but it is dangerous and pernicious to the Souls of Men, for if once Men believe that <hi>Gods Worſhip ſtands but in ſome things, and but at ſome times,</hi> it prevents the looking and hoping for <hi>that Spiritual Worſhip,</hi> Our Lord and Maſter taught, <hi>which is neither at</hi> Samaria<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>s <hi>Mountain nor in</hi> Jeruſalem <hi>below but in Spirit and truth,</hi> and that, we ſay is to be conſtant as well as every where; again to believe this diſtinction <hi>that we are not to ſerve God alwayes and in all things,</hi> this prevents the looking and hoping for the effect of <hi>that Prayer</hi> Our Lord taught his Diſciples and us, as we become his Diſciples, and that is, <hi>thy Kingdom come, thy will be done, on earth, as 'tis in Heaven,</hi> and to be ſure that is equal, conſtant, and continual.</p>
            <p>Further, to teach that we are not to <hi>ſerve God alwayes and in all things,</hi> as it ſets God at a diſtance, ſo it prevents the looking for as well as the receiving of that bleſſed Union Our Lord and Saviour ſpeaks of, and that is being <hi>made perfect in one through him, by which God becomes all in all, ſeen, felt, taſted and praiſed in all we doe, what ever it is;</hi> but believing <hi>Gods Worſhip and Service ſtands but in ſome things, and but at ſome times,</hi> as it certainly prevents the knowledge of what is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove expreſſed, ſo it ſets up <hi>a falſe reſt,</hi> then which nothing is more pernitious and dangerous to the Souls of Men; we intreat you to conſider of this Doctrine; for where the New Man is truly put on, all is made anew, not only the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens but the Earth alſo, and there all is done to the Praiſe of God to eating and drinking and every thing elſe.</p>
            <p>But on a Civil account we look upon this diſtinction unſafe, for we know no Civil Government but that of <hi>Caeſars;</hi> therefore none amongſt us, but what is Religious, and founded on Religious Principles, in which Faith and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience is to be truly concerned in all we doe; <hi>For without Faith it is impoſſible to pleaſe God</hi> (tho we may men,) and this
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:98376:15"/>ſeems too much inſiſted on;) we are to walk by faith and not by ſight, <hi>for 'tis the Juſt Man that lives by his faith,</hi> and <hi>if he lives by it, he cannot be without Faith in any act and live to God;</hi> Pray mind that; for Faith is as needful to our Souls in the living to God, as the Air is to our Natural Bodies, for the living in this World. As for your inſtances of thoſe things <hi>that do not relate to God, Faith, Conſcience, and Religion,</hi> that is, <hi>keeping the Neceſſitous, rebuking and reſtoreing diſorderly Walkers,</hi> &amp;c. We ſay thoſe things are Acts of Religion and Conſcience, or the Apoſtle <hi>James</hi> was out, (1ſt. <hi>Ch:</hi> 27 <hi>verſ</hi>) and cannot be done acceptably to God <hi>without Faith and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
                  <gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>cience,</hi> (tho they may without Womens diſtinct and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant Meeting for Government) for if thoſe Acts above could be done rightly <hi>without Faith,</hi> what hindred the <hi>Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſes</hi> acceptance? For who did them better then they in the outward appearance? But as our Righteouſneſs is to exceed theirs, ſo if thoſe outward acts be done better by us then them, they muſt be done in the Faith, in the ſenſe of Gods Preſence and Power, <hi>,that workes both the will and deed that's done to his Praiſe;</hi> and this all Forma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſts as well as the <hi>Phariſes</hi> wanted to do them in, and they muſt needs want that Faith, that gives acceptance with God, who conclude <hi>thoſe things are not acts of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion and Conſcience.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But to diſtinguiſh things into Civil and Religious, for this purpoſe, that we might perform, what you are pleaſed to call Civil, without taking notice of Conſcience, which being di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly to pleaſe and humour you in your Opinions and Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, what is clearer, then that the Form you are ſetting up and ſtriving for, to the loſs of Charity, and good will, is really to be and is <hi>a Form without Power?</hi> Seeing according to your diſtinction it may very eaſily be performed without Faith and Conſcience. On this account pray conſider, if you may not as juſtly be withſtood or turned from, as thoſe
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:98376:15"/>the Apoſtle ſpeaks of; We intreat you to be ſerious in this matter, while Balm in <hi>Gilead</hi> may be had to heal our wounds and bruiſes, that is, to cure our Diviſions and remove our Disſatisfaction. But further, (You ſay <hi>did thoſe things</hi> (of difference) <hi>require Faith, or did they appertain to Worſhip as if you were obliged to Worſhip God only in ſome Place, Time Geſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, Raiment, with ſuch Words, or Forms of ſpeech,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>your Plea and Objection was good (page</hi> 4)</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſwer,</hi> True Worſhip cannot be impoſed, for 'tis a ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving God according to his mind, in which Mans preſcripti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons have no place, becauſe ſuch the Father only ſeeks out to ſerve him, and it appears that Goſpel Worſhip ought to be conſtant, <hi>for ſuch as are Joyned unto the Lord are one Spirit,</hi> and they that deny a conſtant Serving and Worſhiping of God, it is becauſe they do not know this Union of being <hi>Joyned unto the Lord in one Spirit;</hi> how ever the worſhip you mean and intend is conſtant or it is not, (for we would by no means miſtake you;) if not conſtant, it relates to our Publick Aſſemblies only, and ſo to Preaching and Praying and ſuch other Publick acts as is done and performed at thoſe certain times and Places, and becauſe thoſe things that is the preſent occaſion of difference in a ſtrict ſenſe, do not relate to thoſe Publick acts for Worſhip in our Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies, therefore in your ſenſe there can be no Impoſition up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Conſcience, by Impoſing thoſe things; but then pray obſerve what follows and that is, <hi>that there is no ſerving of God but in our Publick Aſſemblies,</hi> nor (if you pleaſe) <hi>uſe of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, but when ſo met together;</hi> On this account, Pray why do you refuſe to put off your Hats, to uſe the word <hi>you</hi> to a ſingle Perſon, to pay Tithes and ſeveral ſorts of Taxes for according to this Notion of Worſhip and Service thoſe things are Civil and not Religious; we do not mention thoſe things as indifferent; but to ſhew, how by indeavouring to avoid one error you run into another.</p>
            <pb n="30" facs="tcp:98376:16"/>
            <p> But if we are to Worſhip and Serve God conſtantly, as we ſay we are, we ought to wait to know and be ſenſible of him every where, and upon all occaſions; but we ſay this cannot be done without Faith, for without Faith we cannot be ſenſible of his Preſence as the Governour of our actions, nor can our deeds be done or wrought in him without it; well then if we are thus to ſerve God, and this cannot be done without Faith, then we ſay, if the thing you contend for was really good, we muſt, if we ſerve God, firſt know them to be good; thus on this foot in your own ſenſe our Plea and Objection is good, becauſe the Thing in Difference relates to the Service of God.</p>
            <p>You explede in other Societies the impoſſing Time, Geſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and Raiment, in the Worſhip of God, but pray conſider if you are not doing ſomething of the ſame Nature; for you muſt grant that the Worſhip and Service of God ought to be conſtant or it ought not; if it ought not to be conſtant, you ty it to ſome certain times and Places, and herein agree with thoſe you reprehend; but if you allow it conſtant, the impoſſition of new things under this Notion of Civil is out of doors; But further this Form that you'r Impoſing with all the reaſon and force you have, is <hi>that</hi> to a Society, <hi>that</hi> a Garment is to particular Perſons; it is true and as truly granted without any reſerve, that what is ſimple is need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful in both caſes; for we can not be well without a Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment whileſt cloathed with thoſe Houſes of Clay, neither as we are particular Perſons, nor as a Religious Society; but ſuperfluity is dangerous on both hands; for if ever the mind get out to think and conclude that it deſerves honour and reſpect, for the Garment, for the Form's ſake in comes thoſe additions of ſuperfluity; from hence on a Religious ſcore comes in Opinion and Ceremony, and this to make it more Glorious and Beautiful; that it may have more re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect and acceptance both with God and Man; and thus
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:98376:16"/>both on a Religious ſcore as well as on a Civil <hi>Men grow proud of that which ſhews their Poverty, and rich in conceit by truſting in that which at the ſame time demonſtrates their want;</hi> did they underſtand or rightly conſider of things; <hi>for as clothing to our bodies ſhews our want and not our perfection, even ſo do Forms in Religion ſhew our fall and want;</hi> and therefore the more we ſeem to need and are burthened with Ceremony, the more our want and miſery appears, if we could but ſee it. For this cauſe where this is truly ſeen and conſidered, ſuch content themſelves with what is ſimply needful, knowing <hi>by how much as they ſtand in need of little by ſo much they come near<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er their firſt being;</hi> and then ſuch in ſtead of adding of Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and Ceremony to perfect them, do wait to have ſuch things fulfill'd as much as may be for Righteouſneſs ſake; on this account we way ſafely ſay <hi>the leſs Ceremony the more truth,</hi> and the leſs noiſe about the Formallity of Form, the more hopes ſuch wait for the knowledge of God in Chriſt, which <hi>is life Eternal;</hi> but to apply the matter, the difference you make with us is not about what is ſimply needful to Society, for you grant <hi>we are one in judgment with you in the Worſhip and Doctrines of truth, and owns both the end and means of good Order, (Page</hi> 11) then pray conſider, If it be not hard for you to differ with Us about that which neither relates to the Worſhip nor Doctrines of Truth.</p>
            <p>In ſhort, generally ſpeaking, you have allowed us for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly as true Worſhipers of God without <hi>this new Mode or Faſhion</hi> and you do ſo ſtill, or you do not; if you do, by what rule can you in the leaſt exclude us your Communion in thought word or deed? But if you do not allow us to be true Worſhipers of God and Members of the Society, without we put on this new Mode and Faſhion, that you are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending for what is more apparent and clear, then that it it is the Raiment or (which is worſe) the Faſhion of it that is brought in as Terms of Communion and thereby
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:98376:17"/>Impoſed for us to Worſhip God in, if we will be of your Society? Look to it, for while you are thus buthened about Ceremony or about the Formallity of Form, the interpretation of what is writing upon this wall of Sepera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion that you make, will be, that you are weighed in the Bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lance and <hi>found wanting.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Page 6. <hi>You ſay to expect complyance of Members of a Society to ſuch Methods of Order as the Elders thereof have exhorted to and the generallity of the People have imbraced, and which the Major part of thoſe that Diſſent, declare they Diſſent from, more for fear of ſuffering an infringement of their Chriſtian Liberty then on diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like of the matter it ſelfe, this (you ſay) cannot be call'd Impoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion upon Conſcience becauſe expedients of Order,</hi> &amp;c.</p>

<pb n="34" facs="tcp:98376:18"/>are concern'd; but what is this to prove a neceſſity for <hi>Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mens diſtinct Meeting for Government in the Society?</hi> Nothing ſurely; Women are concern'd in their own Marriages, and ſometimes publickly in perticular caſes; and what then, therefore they muſt be ſo far concern'd in the Publick Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtration of our Church or State Government, as if we could neither have Diſcipline nor Society without their conſtant and diſtinct Meeting to uphold us; what's this, but by a perticular Caſe or Act, to prove in general a ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity for them to be Church or State Rulers? We will not ſay the Argument is fallacious but we may ſafely ſay 'tis frivolous.</p>
            <p>But again, <hi>Why Women apart ſay you</hi> (that are disſatisfied? To which our Author anſwers (and indeed 'tis well worth ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving conſidering the weight that lyes upon it, much of the difference depending upon this modification, and he is ſo far from leaving out any thing that may contribute to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifie this Point, that he tells us his thoughts and all) <hi>We think</hi> ſayes the Author (and you think with him by the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation of his thoughts) <hi>for a very good reaſon</hi> (well pray mind this good reaſon, nay this very good one if you can believe it on ſecond thoughts) <hi>Well</hi> (ſayes the Author) <hi>the Church increaſeth</hi> and what then? <hi>This</hi> (ſayes he) <hi>increaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the buſineſs,</hi> and is this all that we might ſo juſtly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect to acquit you of Formallity and Impoſition? Indeed this is a poor ſorry buſineſs to convince us, that there is a neceſſity for Womens diſtinct and conſtant Meeting for Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, in our Society, whether you'l inforce it under the Notion of Civil or Religious, whileſt the whole body of Chriſtians never yet increaſt ſo much as to find that Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod Serviceable, much leſs a neceſſity for it.</p>
            <p>But to make the moſt we can of this <hi>very good reaſon,</hi> by following it as far as it is good for any thing; ſuppoſe then there might be ſuch an increaſe of Friends in ſome Places, as
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:98376:18"/>might poſſibly conſtitute a neceſſity for Womens Meetings, yet where no ſuch increaſe is, there is nothing to do for this <hi>very good reaſon;</hi> therefore to ſet up Womens Meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings univerſally is wrong, becauſe it is ſet up not with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to the increaſe for Service, but the formallity of the thing; for in this <hi>(Page 6)</hi> You tell us, <hi>it is the end that allwayes conſtitutes the means,</hi> and here you tell us, <hi>that the increaſe makes the buſineſs,</hi> and as buſineſs is that end, therefore on thoſe terms, where there is no increaſe; there is no buſineſs, and where no buſineſs no end, and where no end there need no means; and 'tis certain in many Places there is no increaſe ſince the thing came in queſtion, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore as it is againſt the truth, ſo 'tis againſt <hi>your very good reaſon</hi> to impoſe them univerſally upon our Society; thus to impoſe them is a wrong, that you ought to avoid, both according to reaſon and truth.</p>
            <p>But further, according to this reaſon that <hi>the increaſe makes the Service,</hi> a decreaſe takes it away; therefore where there is a decreaſe in ſtead of an increaſe, as the Service is at an end, we hope you will give leave to lay them by, and we think you can hardly deny this; for as (in your ſenſe) there is not <hi>matter of Conſcience;</hi> Conſcience you know cannot be pleaded to uphold them; and if the pretence of Service be a wanting, to what purpoſe are they indeavoured to be kept up; except for meer Formal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity? The endeavouring of Unity there being the Rock, on which all others have ſplit; But in ſhort, either your El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, that have exhorted to this of Womens Meeting and have uſed your Authority with the People for the keeping them up till you have made theſe Rents Diviſions and Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſatisfaction, did believe and judge that Friends was faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to God without Womens Meeting, that is before they had them, or that they was not; if they was not faithful to God, did you think the ſetting up Womens Meetings for
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:98376:19"/>Government in the Society would doe the buſineſs? What do you ſay. Did you think they would keep out the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil or baffle the Serpent? Indeed if that was true, things is much altered ſince the beginning. But if you did believe that Friends was faithful, how could you imagine they would not receive what was needful without force? Pray conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der <hi>is not our Principle univerſall? And is not the Spirit of truth ſufficient to lead into all truth?</hi> Then muſt not every Man, at leaſt every Meeting know beſt what was Service<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able for them, or what they ought to do? If ſo, what need we pray of more then recommendation? Except you were afraid the Spirit of Truth would not lead into this Practice, and why? Except you know it was not a truth, and if not a truth, will you differ with us for things that ought not be obſerved as a truth? Pray Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider of it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Page</hi> the 8. and 9) You are pleaſed to tell us of the great benefits of Women diſtinct Meeting for Government, <hi>For</hi> (ſay you <hi>to confirm it) two buſineſſes is doing at the ſame time, which</hi> (ſay you) <hi>in Country Places and Winter Seaſons where Friends come</hi> 10 <hi>or</hi> 15 <hi>Miles to a Meeting muſt needs be very convenient and comfortable,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſwer,</hi> Indeed You are hard beſet to keep up the credit of your Opinion, while ſuch Lame Notions are given for reaſon; for this makes Womens Meetings Serviceable, where either they cannot be Practiſed, or to be ſure, are leaſt uſed; for here you give <hi>ſhort dayes and Winter Seaſon,</hi> to make them the more Servicable, ſo that long dayes and Summer Seaſons have the leſs occaſion for them; and yet every body knowes they are then moſt frequent. And again, as you make their greateſt Service to be in Country Places, where Friends come ten or 15 Miles to a Meeting, they ſeem clearly to be of leaſt uſe in the City, if at all Service<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able there; becauſe Friends live near together, ſo may
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:98376:19"/>take time to do that buſineſs they cannot in the Country; when truly had not the good Women in the City found either more Service for their Meeting or leſs buſineſs of their own we believe we ſhould never have been preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed with Womens Meeting in the Country to our disſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction; but by how much Friends live farther off one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by this rule Womens Meetings ſtill are the more Service<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, for the farther off one another, the leſs time to meet to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, and ſo ſtand the more need of quicker diſpatch; but all this proves Womens Meeting a very ordinary buſineſs, for where Friends live near together, they may very well excuſe the Women, becauſe they may take time to diſpatch their buſineſs themſe<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ves; and then where they live remote they may as well excuſe them, by reaſon of the inconveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of getting to go; ſo that you ſee all this noiſe, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to this reaſon, is about litle or nothing. But pray is not this reaſon at a litle ods with your <hi>Very good reaſon</hi> befor? For there you made the increaſe of Friends to great Numbers to make the Service, and here the fewneſs; for the remoteneſs does demonſtrate there's but few; but pray be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore you go further then 15 Miles for a Womans Meeting, is the thing practicable you have already ſet on foot? What! 15 Miles to a Meeting for Women and home again in Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſeaſon and ſhort dayes! to which we may add, bad Wayes, long Miles and bad Weather, for you have made no pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſion nor exception that we know of; what think you of it on ſecond thoughts? You know you have told the good Women <hi>the matter does not relate to God, nor is matter of Conſcience,</hi> ſo we hope you will allow them the uſe of their reaſon, for if they find all the buſineſs they can do and goe 15 Miles to a Meeting in ſhort dayes as above, is not worth while, or that they can do all that buſineſs, if any better in their reſpective Meetings, and perhaps with leſs Charge, then this 15 Miles Journey would put them to; and beſides
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:98376:20"/>ſave themſelves at home, where they may be ſure they have an incumbent Duty, will not you be content? What do you ſay? If not, pray may not we juſtly and honeſtly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire if ſuch as injoyne this 15 Miles Journey do themſelves put it in practiſe? If anſwered, that perhaps ſuch as injoyn it do not live ſo remote, and therefore have not occaſion to make the tryal; then may we not ſtill inquire who are beſt Judges of fact, thoſe that do not put in practice or them that have? But what think you of it, was not this Order made in ſome warmer Climate or at leaſt for ſome that dwelt where Dayes are more equal, Wayes better, and Miles not ſo long, as in many parts of <hi>England?</hi> But in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed too much of this, if it had not been to ſhew the fri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volouſneſs of your reaſon) and therein the meanneſs of the cauſe that you have cauſed contention about.</p>

               <hi>Page</hi> the 9. our Author proceeds to tell us his own ſenſe, by this it appears he told us the ſenſe of others before, at leaſt the ſenſe of others as well as his own; which makes our application to ſuch no leſs forceible; <hi>it followes</hi> ſayes my Author, <hi>my own ſenſe upon the whole matter,</hi> (of diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, for that muſt be intended) <hi>is a misaprehending of the Brethrens intentions and an undiſtinguiſhing Zeal againſt Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition on the one hand,</hi> (that is on the ſide of thoſe disſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied) <hi>and a fear on the other ſide</hi> (that is on the ſide of the Elders) <hi>that thoſe who ſo miſtook and misrendred the deſign of the Brethren, were either high minded and unruly, or prone to indue liberty or that they not being the firſt promo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of this Diſcipline,</hi> (to wit Womens Meeting for Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment) <hi>detracted from thoſe that were, and ſo would leſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen the credit of their endeavours,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>I ſay</hi> (ſayes the Author) <hi>my ſenſe is that this on each ſide gave life to the Diviſion,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſwer,</hi> We muſt confeſs this is pretty modeſt of a Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty concerned and deſire you may weigh it, for wee'l con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider it a little; firſt as to <hi>undiſtinguiſhing Zeal againſt Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition,</hi> by this and ſome other paſſages in this Book it appears you allow of ſome kind of Impoſition; therefore as you are the Impoſers, it had been your part to have diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſhed the matter before you had Impoſed upon your Brethren; that ſo if poſſible all this trouble might have been avoided; but notwithſtanding that you ſeem to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt ſomething about it, now when a great deal too late, yet we do not find it well done ſtill; 'tis true you tell us, <hi>we are not to be impoſed upon on a Religious ſcore, nor in things that relate to God;</hi> therefore if as Brethren, we had been conſulted that we might have agreed, if poſſible, about ſixing the bounds of what's Religious and what relates to God; the difference now had been in a leſs compaſs; but you have been far from this Brotherly way, whileſt as
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:98376:21"/>Elders you have not conſulted Us as Brethren, nor as Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of that Society, <hi>that confeſſes but one Lord and one head;</hi> nay rather have not you treated us either not as Brethren or at beſt but as Minors, that know not our right hand from our left, having no skill in the things that relate to God, nor what is Religious, as neither knowing Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience nor who is Lord thereof? And doth not all this appear by the determining the matter without our know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge approbation or conſent? And have not you here di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly trode the ſteps of a wrong impoſing Church accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to your diſtinction <hi>in addreſs to Proteſtants</hi> Page 144, where you ſay, <hi>an Impoſing Church bears witneſs of her ſelf ſhe will be both Party and Judge,</hi> &amp;c. And is not this di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly your State? For as Parties, have not you introduced your Opinions? And as Judges have not you determined the matter againſt us? We intreat you to weigh the matter ſeriouſly, for if this was wrong and evil in others, it cannot be good or right in you; for by how much as our com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming together, as a Society, is more voluntary and free then any other People, that we know of on a Religious ſcore, by ſo much is the point more tender, and therefore any thing of unjuſt Impoſition more evil.</p>
            <p>2dly. As to our <hi>miſapprehending the Brethrens intention in that caſe:</hi> We believe we have not miſapprehended them at all; however ſhall be as Charitable as we can in the explaining of our ſelves; therefore we ſay the Brethren might intend well, to wit, the credit of the Society and that others might be gathered over to our Form. Yet all this does not prove but they was miſtaken in the means uſed to do it; for 'tis without doubt that the builders of <hi>Babel</hi> (a Figure of all the miſtaken Builders on a Religious ſcore) in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended no leſs then the credit and preſervation of their So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cieties, and to make their Mountain the gate to Heaven, that others might be obliged to come by them away; the
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:98376:21" rendition="simple:additions"/>
               <hi>Phariſes</hi> was as ſolicitous in the like caſe and we believe there has been the ſame care and pretenſes in all the Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mations. And conclude that you as well as we, judge that all thoſe was wrong, and miſtaken, and that their miſtake was chiefly <hi>Ignorance of Gods power and righteouſnes, as well as of his nearneſs,</hi> and therefore in ſtead of waiting for Gods power to preſerve and his righteouſneſs to adorn them, they indea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured it by their own that could never anſwer the end de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned, and truly we believe you are under the like miſtake, how ſtrange ſoever things may appear to you, 'tis certainly the acting of your own Spirit in the likeneſs of truth, that hath deceived you; we would not have you angry, for there's no occaſion to be ſurpriſed, ſince you know beforehand we are Disſatisfyed, and therein do oppoſe you; now we muſt op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe you either as believing you right or wrong, in this of Impoſition; if you ſhould conclude that we oppoſe you as believing you are right you make us really Judges, and as this will offer violence to our underſtanding we muſt of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity (we can not avoid it but) know you are miſtaken and do really want Charity, this muſt caſt off all accommoda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; for on this account the difference would be made on your part, as great as betwixt Chriſt and <hi>Belial</hi> or light and darkneſs; therefore to prevent your falling into this gulph all we can, and yet without any flattering we muſt ſay, We do oppoſe you as really believing you are wrong; Now that wrong muſt be managed by deſign, or through ſome miſtake, if we ſhould conclude it really by deſign you might perhaps, (and that truly) conclude us uncharitable on the other hand, (and two extreams can never meet) therefore we do place the wrong you do on a miſtake (as above) for we can believe you might intend well, to wit, the credit of the Society; but we ſee thoſe additions you uſe, as means, cannot do it, nor lyes it in your power by any additions, that you can make uſe of, to preſerve the Name. The Name <hi>Quaker</hi> will
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:98376:22"/>loſe its Luſtre and Beauty as well as other Names, <hi>for the glory of all fleſh is but as the Flower of the Field,</hi> that the ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thering may be ſtill more Spiritual as well as more univerſal, for <hi>'tis only they that doe Righteouſly that is Righteous, and 'tis only thoſe that fear God and workes righteouſneſs that are accepted of him,</hi> and ſuch he accepts every where; and he accepts none elſe amongſt us, nor have we this righteouſneſs as we are of this Form, Society or Name, <hi>but as we fear and love God,</hi> ſo that if you cannot raiſe up this fear and love by which that Righteouſneſs is wrought, that gives acceptance, you can do litle except weary and burthen your ſelves in the inventing of New Order; that way indeed you may become <hi>a Sect</hi> as a Nation that warreth againſt other Nations, but hereby you'l miſs the <hi>true unity, that ſtands in the Spirit of Righteouſneſs;</hi> by ſeeking it and placing it in the formal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of Form.</p>
            <p>3dly, But our Author makes the cauſe of difference on the other ſide (that on the ſide of the Elders) to <hi>be their fear, that ſuch as did oppoſe, did it becauſe they are highminded, or unruly or for undue liberty or becauſe not Parties concern'd</hi> &amp;c. (as before.</p>

               <hi>Anſwer,</hi> It ſeems there was no Fence for your fear, you were afraid but you did not know of what, we grant thoſe that are afraid in the dark may have ſtrange apprehenſions and if in that fear they proceed to judgment and go about to provide for their ſecurity, they may well err in the one and miſaply the other, why? Becauſe they'r in the dark, that is in doubt and want Patiene to ſtay till the light come, <hi>that makes things manifeſt as they are,</hi> and truly this appears to be your condition with your Brethren; which have been occaſion of ſo much trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and ſtrife, and why ſhould this be taken ill, or thought hard? You know thoſe that are in fear as you were muſt needs be in doubt, and thoſe in doubt are really in the dark, and it in that doubt or darkneſs they proceed to Judgment they muſt needs err, all this is clear to us on your part, for you
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:98376:22" rendition="simple:additions"/>did not know the true cauſe of your Brethren's Disſatisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and oppoſing you, and therefore tho you Imagined many cauſes (as above) you ſtill miſs'd it; now had you been certain, you could not have been in fear, for that is doubtful; 'tis true the caſe might have been ſuch as you might have been troubled, but you was in fear and in that fear did go about to preſerve your ſelves, and here was the miſchief of the miſtake, thoſe that took this great fright had power to Intreſt the Major part (the body as its call'd) in their ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity under the moſt ſpecious pretence <hi>that particulars or others muſt be accountable to the Society.</hi> Which tho true in many caſes, yet is falſe in ſome, and that is, when it truly concerns the Lord, and here all or moſt Societies have err'd, and your Plea is now no more then an old Artifice of the Enemy, by which juſt and Conſcientious Men have been made ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferers, in moſt Ages, as well as in Ours, here was the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of our miſchief and miſery, and the cauſe of it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinues; for thoſe of whom you were afraid muſt need be clothed according to your fear, and what followes whether your Judgement was right or wrong 'tis all one, they muſt ſuffer as evil doers by being kill'd and deſtroy'd in the minds and deſires of the unthinking; few Synods and Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils of Men on this account but they have err'd; but as eaſily as they have been miſtaken, it has been as hard to retrieve the wrong, nay on this ſcore have they not rather been tempted to ſeek out ſhifts and evaſions to cover a fault, then confeſs a failing? If it be inquired who is thus concerned in our caſe? The <hi>Anſwer</hi> is ready, but in ſtead of expoſing Names, we could deſire ſuch might compare their miſtake on this foot, with what hath happen'd even through moſt Ages, and ſo conſider what they have done and do ſo no more, but in ſtead thereof make uſe of their power to make thoſe things <hi>indifferent,</hi> that have given occaſion by being <hi>Poſitive;</hi> and then we could eaſily paſs all by and love freely; for truly
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:98376:23" rendition="simple:additions"/>as much has been forgiven, we can forgive much, and what hazard in all this? when you ſay <hi>thoſe things relate not to God?</hi> And truly <hi>you'r far from becoming all unto all while you cannot diſpenſe with your own Opinions.</hi>

               <hi>Page</hi> the 10th Our Author tells us <hi>our difference now is more in Spirit then in fact, in mind more then matter,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſwer,</hi> Seing Our Author makes this difference ſo litle as to matter of fact, as not to amount to matter of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, we hope in time you will ſee it your Place to take it away by making your Opinion indifferent; that ſo in ſtead of falling out by the way, we might quietly travel toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther for the <hi>true reſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But to proceed, <hi>It is</hi> (our Author ſayes), <hi>come to this,</hi> whether <hi>Converſation ſhould belong to Women as well as Men</hi> and over this he thinks we are gotten for the moſt part, it ſeems then we are gotten a little nearer together then we were in his Judgment, and if any miſtake is removed 'tis very well; but pray who ever denyed Womens Concern in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation as well as Men? They was alwayes concern'd in their own and ſuch as was under their charge, we were allwayes of this mind, and to this the Apoſtle agrees where he wills <hi>the Younger Widdowes to Marry and govern the Houſe,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>And if he took this care for the Un-married, ſurely he did nor forget thoſe that were; but what then? Tho the care of Converſation belongs to them, muſt they every way be as publickly concern'd as Men? What will nothing do but noiſe and Popularitie? Muſt not Men meet but Women muſt meet and at the ſame time, but yet muſt be diſtinct and ſeperate from the Men, tho' but divided by a Curtain in the ſame Room? And is not the Mode of Diviſion moſt of the matter? Muſt they indeed be as far concern'd as the Men? Muſt nothing be done without their conſent and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation? Nay ſure, for we find the Apoſtle checking this
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:98376:23"/>Popularity and affected Government, when he forbids <hi>Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men ſpeaking in the Church,</hi> but this he did not unto Men which makes ſome difference; and if he forbids <hi>Women ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the Church,</hi> certainly he never thought of either mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a Church or Church rulers of them; you'l ſay this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibition did not exclude Women in all caſes; we ſay ſo too; but then it muſt in a general ſenſe, or you make the Apoſtle in a matter he ſeemed ſo earneſt about to ſpeak to no purpoſe.</p>
            <p>2ly. Our Author asketh, <hi>whether Women may not meet ſepe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate from Men?</hi> And for anſwer to this he ſayes, <hi>be pleaſed to take notice of your unavoidable conceſſion you (that are disſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fyed) allow meeting of care in general, and do not abſolutely deny Women their ſhare amongſt the Men,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſ.</hi> All this is right in the ſenſe we take it, but pray who ever denyed honeſt Women to meet apart and diſtinct from Men on occaſion? What need of all this, except to make it better appear how far we agree, that ſo a juſter eſtimate may be taken of our difference? If ſo, all is well ſtill, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore conſider the difference, we ſay <hi>they may meett</hi> on occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion ſeperate from Men, but you ſay <hi>they muſt meet and that conſtantly for Government,</hi> whether there be occaſion for it, or no, tho they go 15 Miles to a Meeting in Winter ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons; what's this but to make buſines rather then want it? And indeed to make a great noiſe about thoſe very things that the more we are concern'd for the more our want and nakedneſs appear? For what does all this noiſe, but de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare that we do not poſſeſs what we profeſs, and are not faithful to our own convictions.</p>
            <p>But to proceed, our Author ſayes to thoſe that are diſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, <hi>You own the end;</hi> what's that? <hi>you (that are diſatisfied) own that the Poor and other things that are eſſential to Society ſhould be taken care for,</hi> that is right, but again ſayes our Author <hi>you allow of the means too;</hi> What's that? <hi>Well that muſt
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:98376:24" rendition="simple:additions"/>be ſuch fitting Methods as may anſwer that end the buſineſs above expreſſed or intended;</hi> well thus far we do agree, and it muſt be granted there is a fitting Method to anſwer the publick buſines or neceſſities of our Society, without Impoſing conſtant diſtinct Womens Meetings for Government, or there is not; if not, let our Author affirm and prove it; for do that honeſtly and take the cauſe; but if there is a fitting Method to anſwer the Publick buſines of our Society with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out this unity in Formallity contended for, why do you differ with Us, except it be for maſterſhip? And if that be it, be plain with us, and ſo end the Diſpute.</p>
            <p>But again our Author ſayes, <hi>You referr the choiſe of your means to the Society, and you as well as we expect a complyance with thoſe Rules,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſ.</hi> Hold a little; for 'tis too much to grant this by whole ſail as little as it is, therefore we will firſt enquire what is intended, for it is neceſſary to underſtand what we are to comply with, pray therefore obſerve who our Author ſpeaks to, for he ſpeaks in the Plural, <hi>You</hi> (ſayes he) <hi>referr the choice of your means to the Society,</hi> Pray who ſpeaks he to? Why, in this caſe he muſt needs ſpeak to thoſe Friends that are ſeperated for they having only diſtinct Meetings and Diſcipline, it is referrable to them or none; now if he ſpeaks to thoſe Friends, that is through diſatisfaction Seperated, then he muſt ſpeak to the whole Communitie, or but to a part; if he ſpeak but to a part of them, pray what part of thoſe that's ſeperated? This is neceſſary, for we ought to underſtand his meaning; but if he ſpeaks to the whole Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munitie; then what is this Society, that thoſe that's ſepe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated referr the choiſe of the means or Rules to for Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline? For here's a Society in a Society, and this ſeems a miſtery; pray let this be unfoulded; for this Society in a So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety ſeems ſome active buſineſs, 'tis ſet forth as the Soul to the body, pray how comes this Society? What, is it <gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="1 span">

               </gap>? Why; let it be what it will, God makes it, or Man, or otherwiſe it muſt make it ſelf? It ſelf it cannot make ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to reaſon and truth, therefore if this Society makes it ſelfe, as its beginning muſt be Uſurpation, its end will be Tyrany and Oppreſion, now if thoſe you write to ſubmit to any ſuch Uſurpation amongſt themſelves, whileſt they deny it to you, pray prove it upon them; for do that and they will appear guilty of what they accuſe you for; but if this Society be of Mans making, that is, that thoſe that are ſeperated, have ſelected ſome from among them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to govern them, in whom they have depoſited a Power to make Rules and Lawes for them to which the whole is to be ſubject without examination, tho 'tis true in this it can not be ſaid that others have inſlaved them becauſe it is their own choice, but if they have done thus pray prove it upon them? For ſtill they will in ſome part be guilty of that they accuſe you of, there is only this difference, that thoſe thus choſen may act rationally according to the Power lodged in them whileſt you act without any ſuch choice or aſſignation that we know of, the firſt indeed may be ſaid to be ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional, <hi>but is it really Ignorance of the ſufficiency of Chriſt to make any ſuch choice and a diſhonour to our Lord, as it takes away examination,</hi> but to have any to Impoſe themſelves upon us is ſlavery to boot.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Laſtly,</hi> But if this Soceiety is of our Lords making, then they muſt act according to the deſcription of Government our Lord has given and adviſed to in his Diſciples, where he tells us, <hi>he that rules ſhould be as him that ſerves, and he that would be greateſt in his Government muſt be Servant to all the reſt,</hi> then not as Lords and Maſters to Impoſe upon the reſt, for as <hi>his Kingdom is not of this World, no more is his Government like the government of this World,</hi> for that ſtands in force and moſtly in ſubtilty and contrivance, but he takes his Kingdom and Government in the hearts of Men by <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>victions
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:98376:25"/>and perſwaſions only,</hi> which is diametrically contrary to wrath ſubtilty, force and violence.</p>
            <p>But to Apply what is ſaid to our caſe; as we are a publick Society, there is buſineſs belongs to Us, this muſt be done by ſome body, and for that end 'tis needful to have time and place appointed that ſuch as are willing to ſerve their Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren and Friends may meet; and becauſe all cannot meet, ſuch as do, are allowed to act according to thoſe Rules the Society have imbrac'd, and if any thing farther ſeems needful to them, ſuch have liberty, as the reſt of their Brethren have, and not otherwiſe, to recommend it, but cannot Command; for as we are a free and voluntary Society <hi>confeſſing but one head and Lord,</hi> the liberty of examination, muſt be preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, as well that we may continue a free People, as alſo and chiefly that we may conſerve that <hi>honour due unto the Lord,</hi> and where according to the truth and our conſtitution examination ought to be preſerved, a choice muſt be allowed, ſo that on this foot recommendation is the higheſt any Man or any Aſſembly among us can go in the adding of new things nor will or can ſuch as have the mind of Chriſt deſire more; therefore if what ſuch recommend meet with acceptance, all is well; but if not, all is well ſtill to ſuch as meet to ſerve their Friends and Brethren, and not to be their Lords and Maſters now thoſe that have ſeperated from you on the account of Impoſition writes after this Coppy, which our Lord and Maſter hath ſet, they will never differ at an El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſhip nor maſterſhip, and truly had you given this good example of ſelfe denyal, <hi>we could have given you double Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour,</hi> for we are for good Order, thô againſt Maſterſhip, and for good Government but againſt Arbitrary proceedings; nor let any think we cannot have good Order and Government ſo far as its neceſſary without a deſpotick Power be lodged in ſome to rule over us; nay the Civil Conſtitution of our own Nation demonſtrates the contrary, for it allows of Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:98376:25"/>and Government but denys <hi>Arbitrary</hi> Power, and if in Civil there has been this ſenſe of Freedom to provide a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Lordſhip and Dominion how much more ought we to avoid it in Religion? <hi>where Chriſt our Lord is to be our Example,</hi> that overcame by ſuffering, <hi>and through Death deſtroyed him that had the Power of Death.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But again <hi>Page</hi> 11 Our Author ſayes <hi>The Queſtion is whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in fact Womens Meetings be part of that Diſcipline the Church admits of,</hi> and to this the Author ſayes, <hi>'tis evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent the Church of God generally ſpeaking receives and Prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tices it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſ.</hi> This is litle to conclude us, when 'tis conſidered that the greateſt part of all Churches through all Ages, and that in your own ſenſe, at laſt have been wrong and miſtaken. But to the matter, if we take <hi>the Church of God</hi> in a general ſenſe (according to Addreſs to <hi>Proteſtants Page</hi> 154) we may ſafe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſay ſhe neither receives nor practices Womens Meeting for Diſcipline, but we take it he means Friends; and if not too much to apply the term only to them; then we ſay, the contrary ſaying muſt be as true as this and of as much force to determine the matter againſt you, <hi>the Church of God ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally ſpeaking</hi> (ſayes our Author) <hi>receives and Practices Womens Meetings;</hi> what then? But not ſpeaking generally doth neither receive nor practice them; in our Authors ſenſe both parts make the Church, tho not receiving this of Womens meetings by the leſſer part hinders not them from being of the Church, and we are ſure the practiſing of them by the greater part can make them no more; then who is this that dare for their <hi>mere Opinion ſake</hi> divide by force and voilence what God hath Joyned together? You know what Chriſt our Lord ſaid that <hi>there ſhould be no Maſterſhip among his;</hi> pray then deliver us from this yoak of Bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage, <hi>which neither we nor our Fathers were able to bear,</hi>
               <pb n="50" facs="tcp:98376:26"/>to wit, <hi>Maſterſhip in Religion,</hi> and we hope we ſhall be wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to wait till you are better inform'd.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Page</hi> the 13 our Author proceeds as followeth, <hi>As in no Age the reſiſters and gainſayers of care and Order in any of the Lords Servants have paſſed without the marks of Gods rebuke, ſo they that have conteſted and oppoſed the wiſdome of God in his faithful Servants have ever fail'd of their purpoſe and have been finally manifeſted to have been led by a wrong Spirit, and as obſervable it is that thoſe by whom the Lord has eminently appeared and who were the firſt Inſtruments of his ſeveral diſpenſations to the Sons of Men have allwayes exerciſed that Authority amongſt the People they have gathered and have conſtantly been preſerved from falling away though ſome or other have riſen up againſt them with that clamor as if they had ſet up themſelves and were gone from what they taught or were or took too much upon them but what have they all come to, read and Judge,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſwer,</hi> 'Tis clear that the genuine and direct ſenſe of all this is to get us into a dependance upon Man under the Notion of Elderſhip, and to perſwade or affright into that Implicite Reverence as that we ſhould not examine what is ſaid or done by them, but the receiving things preſumptive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly on the vallue of others, hath fill'd the Profeſſors of Chriſtianity with <hi>Ignorance</hi> as well as <hi>error,</hi> as is excellently ſet forth in <hi>addreſs to Proteſtants</hi> (<hi>Page</hi> 136 and ſo to the end of that Head) there wants nothing but application and that is needful becauſe Example prevailes more then Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept. Now that we may avoid that fault in our ſelves, which you have ſo warmly and truly taxed in others, we will as freely examine this Part as we have done the reſt; and for that end pray who are theſe Servants you intend and how muſt we certainly know them? For truly as before if there muſt be a dependance they ought to be ſet forth, and what is all this care you ſpeak of? Is it that of <hi>Maryes</hi>
               <pb n="51" facs="tcp:98376:26"/>or that of <hi>Martha's?</hi> That was ſo Cumbred about many things that thought <hi>Mary</hi> took little care, and what was the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, but that her ſelfe was cumbred too much? It ſeems the <hi>latter</hi> by this Noiſe and Clamor that is made about it; 'tis a part that may be taken away which makes thoſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern'd ſo ſenſible of it, that they cannot let others be quiet that <hi>like</hi> Mary <hi>have choſen the better part.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But do you conclude or think that ſuch as are diſſatisfy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with Womens Meetings doe therein oppoſe the mind of the Lord in any of his Servants, yet how ſhould that be? Whilſt you grant <hi>thoſe things are not matter of Conſcience and that they'r one in judgement with you in the Worſhip and Doctrines of truth,</hi> what is it not a Doctrine of truth and matter of Conſcience to believe true Prophets? Again what do you mean by thoſe words <hi>conteſting the Wiſdom of God?</hi> Do you intend that Womens Meetings (the matter in queſtion) was ſet up by <hi>the Wiſedom of God</hi> to be practiſed? But pray how can this be when you tell us that <hi>the things in difference relate not to God nor is matter of Conſcience?</hi> What ſet up <hi>by the Wiſdome of God</hi> to be obſerved and yet neither <hi>relates to God, nor is matter of Conſcience?</hi> What think you of it? Is not this very ſtrange and inconſiſtant? If not pray explain your ſelves better.</p>
            <p>But further you tell us, <hi>thoſe made eminent have been conſtantly preſerved from falling away tho oppoſed; but what came ſuch to as did oppoſe read and Judge.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſwer,</hi> Here you bear witneſs to your ſelves, and what is this but to affright Us into ſubmiſſion to your pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences? But pray how muſt we know thoſe things, for exclud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Apoſtles times and thoſe before, where muſt we read all this you tell of? What do you bid us <hi>read and Judge,</hi> and can not tell where, or at leaſt does not? To be ſure this is noiſe, to ſay no more, for it can not be to Edification,</p>
            <pb n="52" facs="tcp:98376:27"/>
            <p> Again, what do you mean by thoſe <hi>Diſpenſations</hi> he ſpeaks of? He might at leaſt have given an Inſtance of what he intended, which being omitted, 'tis like the reſt, more to amuſe then inform us; but will you allow thoſe dealings of God with <hi>Iſrael</hi> in <hi>Egypt</hi> and ſo into <hi>Canaan,</hi> to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded in the Diſpenſations he ſpeaks of? If you will 'tis well, if not, yet tis clear to us they are a ſign of Gods dealing with Men now, in Order to bring them into peace and reſt with himſelfe, nay what if we ſay a Figure of Gods dealing with Man from the beginning to the end; for firſt here is <hi>Iſrael</hi> in <hi>Canaan</hi> which may ſtand as a Figure of Mans State in Paradice, <hi>Iſraels</hi> going down into <hi>Egipt</hi> by reaſon of Famine, a Figure of Mans driving out of Paradiſe, <hi>Iſrael</hi>'s relief comfort and ſatisfaction in <hi>Egipt,</hi> a Figure of Mans Fall whileſt alive in the World, being dead to God; the Law or Power of Death having dominion over him; and <hi>Iſreal</hi> in bondage in <hi>Egipt</hi> a Figure of Mans fall, and miſery when ſenſible of it, being truly quickned and thereby made to know the Power or Law of ſin in his Members; but ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve this bondage in <hi>Egipt</hi> preceded their deliverance, and made way or prepared them for their going out into the Wilderneſs, now as the Wilnerneſs was a different State to that of <hi>Egipt,</hi> ſo the travel there fitted them for the poſſeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oſ <hi>Canaan;</hi> ſo far as its ſaid of that generation, who had ſeen Gods wonders in <hi>Egipt,</hi> and had experience of his vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous dealings or diſpenſations, that <hi>they did walk ſweetly with the Lord,</hi> but when another Generation aroſe that did not know thoſe things but by hearſay, though they was in the ſame Land, <hi>they ſoon forſook the Lord and ſerved Idols;</hi> from hence there appears a neceſſity for every indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidual ſoul to have experience of thoſe various dealings of God in a ſpiritual ſenſe in Order to their <hi>walking humbly with him.</hi> Obſerve there was perfect different States and diſpenſations <hi>in the ſame age, that is, to the ſame People</hi>
               <pb n="53" facs="tcp:98376:27"/>contrary to what you aſſert; here was <hi>Canaan</hi> Liberty and Freedome, oppoſed to <hi>Egipt</hi> bondage and Oppreſſion, and at laſt <hi>Canaan</hi> reſt to the Wilderneſs Travels; and as there was thoſe real different States and perfect change of diſpenſations in the ſame age, to the ſame People, ſo was their Leader, (obſerve that) as truly changed: For <hi>Moſes</hi> how eminent ſoever in the bringing them out of <hi>Egipt,</hi> and through the Sea, yet could he not bring them through <hi>Jor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dan</hi> into <hi>Canaan,</hi> a Type of the true reſt; no, that was <hi>Joſhua</hi>'s work, <hi>Moſes</hi>'s Miniſter, the Figure of the true Jeſus, which deſerves your ſerious conſideration, for in this change of diſpenſation lies your great miſtake. We might ſay more, but ſhall add only this that what was then in the Figure is now to be done in the Subſtance, what was then done in the Letter, is now to be done in Spirit; for Gods <hi>Iſrael</hi> now is <hi>after the Spirit and not after the fleſh,</hi> and are to be gathered from Man to God; ſo that if you do not throw down your Crowns, there by making way for his Government, by freely delivering up all unto him, but in ſtead thereof by reflecting upon your abillities to Rule, ſhall ſeek to perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuate your Government under the Notion of Elderſhip, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther you that ſeek this dependance, nor thoſe that depend upon you can enter the good Land, of which <hi>Canaan</hi> was a Figure; and what then? If you go not forth again into <hi>Egipt</hi> you muſt die in the wilderneſs.</p>
            <p>But we have more to this purpoſe, in this <hi>Page</hi> it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes, <hi>nor was it ever heard of</hi> (ſayes our Author) <hi>in the dealings of God with the Sons of men that he varyed or chang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his diſpenſations in the life time of the Inſtruments,</hi> (obſerve) <hi>of any of them as ſome have been ready to imagine nor yet in that age in which he has brought them forth,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſwer,</hi> What adoe here is to get your Government eſtabliſhed. If it were Chriſts our Lords, there would be none of this Noiſe; but as ſure as you ſeem you'r miſtaken
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:98376:28"/>that God has varyed his diſpenſations in the ſame age is clear above; for thoſe very People of whom it was teſtified that <hi>they did walk ſweetly with the Lord</hi> were of ſuch as had ſeen Gods wonders in <hi>Egypt,</hi> in the Sea, and at Mount <hi>Sinai,</hi> had known a travel in the Wilderneſs; and their Leader changed, and that before they entered <hi>Canaan,</hi> did know the dividing of the Land, and <hi>a ſitting under their own Vine,</hi> none being left to make them afraid; and this under <hi>Joſhua</hi> and not <hi>Moſes,</hi> according to the Figure, is ſufficient to ſhew the wrongneſs of your aſſertion; but again, that <hi>God never varied or changed his diſpenſation in the life time of the Inſtrument of them nor in that Age,</hi> this is ſtill as wrong as the former, nay falſe in fact, for Inſtance <hi>John</hi> the Baptiſt. For that diſpenſation wherein he was ſo Emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent was truly varyed if not changed in his life time, that it was varyed and to be changed is clear from the Baptiſts own teſtimony, and that it was changed in the ſame Age, is paſt ſcruple or contradiction, and not to <hi>John</hi> Baptiſt only but to Chriſt alſo, firſt in fleſh and then in Spirit.</p>
            <p>Now as thoſe aſſertions are wrong and contrary to the truth, ſo are they of dangerous conſequence to the Souls of men; by perpetuating Mans Government in ſtead of Chriſts; there's ſomething like that ſaying <hi>Where is the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe of his coming? For ſince the Fathers dyed all things con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue alike,</hi> for like to that is this that <hi>God never varied or changed his diſpenſation in the ſame Age, nor in the life time of the Inſtruments of any of them,</hi> in this all things continue alike as they ever did; and then on this foot muſt not you under this profeſſion all degenerate as others have done be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in your ſenſe? But pray how contrary is this to our Saviours advice to his Diſciples and to all Man. For ſayes he, <hi>What I ſay unto you I ſay unto all, Watch;</hi> and why muſt we watch? Why, becauſe <hi>you know not at what hour your Maſter will come,</hi> and pray who is this Maſter, but the Lord
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:98376:28"/>our God; that changes and varies his diſpenſations when it pleaſeth him, but rarely or never perceived by the Carnal mind nor by the greateſt Formaliſt in Religion, no, no they'r the greateſt enemies of it; 'tis true you do not deny but the Diſpenſation may be changed but though you can not tell certainly when it ſhall be, yet you preſume to tell and that certainly when it ſhall not be; and that's <hi>not in this Age;</hi> ſo that whiles this Age laſts, we need not Watch in your ſenſe; 'tis true your words imply God may alter this Diſpenſation when this Age is over, and when all thoſe eminent Inſtruments are dead, but not till then however, and thus by Preaching us into a <hi>ſleepy Ignorance</hi> you hope to ſecure your Government as long as you and we live, and indeed that's long enough. But if you could watch for us that we need not but may reſt ſecure as long as this Age laſts or you live, yet ſeeing the Diſpenſation in your ſenſe may be changed when this Age is over, and when all thoſe Emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent Inſtruments are dead; and then ſeeing there may be occaſion to Watch <hi>for the Maſters coming,</hi> it would be needful at leaſt for the good of others if not for us, to ſet forth fairly, <hi>what you mean by this Age, and who certainly are thoſe Eminent Inſtruments, and what this Diſpenſation is</hi> that you intend, that ſo when this Age is over and thoſe Inſtruments are all dead, then People may prepare to watch <hi>for the Maſters coming</hi> to change this Diſpenſation; all this and more is the Genuin Conſequence of thoſe Poſitions and aſſertions, which we muſt ſay, is as carnal as they'r pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumptious, and is a plain deferring of the Maſters coming; and what followes but what ever did? <hi>A beating of your fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low Servants;</hi> that this is truly the condition and danger of all thoſe that aſſert as above, own or ſtand by it, is to us an undoubted truth, and therefore in order to <hi>awaken ſome</hi> and forwarn others we can do no leſs then aſſert, that <hi>he that is come, is yet to come,</hi> that ſo by a true watching and
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:98376:29"/>waiting for his coming ſome may avoid that great danger thoſe are in, that deferr it.</p>
            <p>And indeed this preſumption that <hi>the Diſpenſation is not to be changed in this Age,</hi> is both your danger and miſtake; for this makes the Diſpenſations of God to lie chiefly in outward Modes of Worſhip, in outward Forms of Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline, and in the Government of Men, and this in ſtead of leading the mind to God, leads from him, becauſe in ſtead of waiting for the Kingdom and Government of Chriſt, and the increaſe of it which is Spiritual, this ſets up what is outward and Carnal, which may be altered and changed from one thing to another, and yet the mind unre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generated; and therefore thoſe diſpenſations of God, that convert the ſoul to God are Spiritual, and are the ſame now they have been through all Ages, of which that unto <hi>Iſrael</hi> and the compleating of that Diſpenſation by our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our is a true and perfect Figure to us and all men; but ſeeing you ſay <hi>there is to be no change of Diſpenſation in this Age,</hi> Pray when is it that you intend to <hi>Preſent</hi> thoſe that depend on you, <hi>as chaſt Virgins to Chriſt?</hi> That they may be mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried unto him; for as this ought to be; ſo certainly you will allow in that State ſuch may ſimply depend on him; it does not appear you intend it as long as you live becauſe you ſay <hi>there is to be no variation or changing of Diſpenſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in this Age</hi> and when may it be expected then? For thoſe that ſucceed you in the Government may as juſtly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny a change of Diſpenſation in their Age as you do in this and to be ſure they'l be as unwilling to allow of it as you; for why? They muſt bear the Image that you beget, and as they will make you their Authority they will build on you, as it has been through all the Reformations, and then as they are not like to know ſo much as ſome have done in this Age they'l be but bigotted the more; <hi>for indeed where there is not a conſtant waiting for the Lords Coming to do
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:98376:29"/>what he pleaſeth with us, a falſe reſt is ſet up,</hi> and ſuch become as much as in them lyes the limiters of God and good Men, and the preventers of the further diſcoveries of the mind of God, but if we come to be a Figure of the Univerſal Church, of which Chriſt our Lord is truly head, we muſt know a change and alteration of the Diſpenſation by which this ſtriv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for Maſterſhip and Ceremony may ceaſe and that in our Age, for 'tis certain that Gods appearance is twofold to Man in the work of reſtoring Man unto himſelf, and if we be of Spiritual <hi>Iſrael</hi> we muſt know a coming through the work of a firſt Covenant, before we can know the Second, whereupon it follows as there muſt be a Preparation before there can be a Choice, there is a Legal Diſpenſation to be known or paſſed through before that of the Goſpel can be fully underſtood.</p>
            <p>'Tis true if we could conſider rightly that the end of all Gods dealing with men is to bring them to himſelfe and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure them for the future againſt the attempts of the Enemy, we might call or eſteem all Goſpel, according to <hi>Addreſs to</hi> Proteſtants (<hi>Page</hi> 82) where 'tis ſaid <hi>the Law is the Goſpel begun, the Goſpel the Law fulfilled or finiſhed, they cannot be parted,</hi> by the word <hi>parted</hi> we conceive he means the Goſpel cannot come or be witneſſed, except it begin in the Law; for when we conſider that all men in their firſt State are concluded under ſin, and that in the work of regeneration there is trouble before peace, and condemnation before Juſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tification, and that <hi>no ſuffering for the preſent ſeems Joyom,</hi> then may we ſay thoſe diſpenſations of Law and Goſpel, firſt and ſecond Covenant are now in being and as diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhable to the Spiritual Traveller as ever.</p>
            <p>'Tis true Chriſt our Lord is Heir of all things, but our firſt knowledge of him is in his deſcending, where he deveſts himſelf of his glory, in this he condeſcends to lay hold of us, or otherwiſe it were impoſſible for us to apprehend or lay
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:98376:30"/>hold of him, you know 'tis written <hi>the holy Spirit was not yet given becauſe that Jeſus was not yet glorified,</hi> and yet he both had Diſciples and they was taught of him, nay when raiſed from the dead and they were ſtill taught of him, they had not yet received the Holy Spirit, for he was not yet aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cended, but when the Power from on high came upon them, the true witneſs that Jeſus was glorified, <hi>then they received the Holy Spirit that was to abide with them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But to apply it, if our firſt knowledge of Chriſt be in his deſcending then muſt we know him aſcend where he was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, or the work cannot be compleated, but this cannot be without a change of diſpenſation; thus inſtead of deny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>it we ought to wait for it. Again when we conſider that ſince tranſgreſſion at leaſt Man is made under a Law wrote or to be wrote in the hearts or minds of all Men (of which that wrote in ſtone to <hi>Iſrael</hi> was but as a Figure) and that by this Law came the true knowledge of <gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="1 word">

                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> this Miniſtration cannot paſs away unfulfilled therefore does our Lord deſcend to aſſiſt us to fulfil this diſpenſation as a Servant, and differeth not from a Servant, tho he is <hi>Lord of all;</hi> you know he was made under the Law to <hi>Iſrael</hi> that he might redeem them truly prepared by it, from under the Law, and he is now as well as then <hi>a Miniſter of the Sanctu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ary</hi> and then muſt we not know him firſt under a Legal diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſation as well as then? For that diſpenſation given to <hi>Iſrael</hi> that he then fulfilled in the fleſh was never given to us, and as that was not to continue, it is the Subſtance of that which remains, that we are to inquire out; God appeared by his ſervants, and by his Son to the houſe of <hi>Iſrael</hi> after the fleſh; the firſt was to prepare, the latter to perfect; and thoſe that are not faithful in the firſt part now, can not know the latter no more then <hi>Iſrael</hi> in the figure did, thus there may be a coming a great way in the firſt part of the work and yet miſs in the latter.</p>
            <pb n="59" facs="tcp:98376:30" rendition="simple:additions"/>
            <p> Well then as there is a Servant ſtate and Sons-ſtate, the firſt is preparation, and anſwers to a Legal diſpenſation, or the miniſtration of Condemnation, but the latter being truly election or choice anſwers to that of the Goſpel or Miniſtration of life, the firſt condemns the ſinner, the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the ſin, now as there muſt be preparation before there can be choice or Election the firſt State is <hi>abſolutely needful,</hi> but yet as there is a better ſtate there is a neceſſity to wait for a change of the firſt to all that comes truly to know the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concilliation to God through the death of Chriſt; <hi>for as we cannot live unto the righteouſneſs of Legal diſpenſation except we dye unto ſin, ſo we cannot know true Sonſhip, except we know a dying to all our righteouſneſs attain'd in the State of Preparation</hi> for we muſt have it before we can part with it.</p>
            <p>In the firſt State we receive a Talent, and except we ſerve God with all our Strength, it cannot rightly be improv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, therefore muſt we put to our ſtrength and thus we coope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate with the grace given to make all according to the pattern ſhewed in the Holy Mount, and here we follow Chriſt in the Regeneration, that is in the begitting and quickning to fulfil the work given us to do, for we have a work to do; and as we do cooperate with the Talent to do that work ſomething of the Man, ſomething of the fleſh remains, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore muſt we come in to the Death of Chriſt, which we can never truly know, except we firſt be quickned by him, ſo then quickning is preparation, but to come in to the death of Chriſt in the fleſh is the perfecting the Covenant of works; you know, whilſt our Lord was in the Fleſh he told his Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, <hi>he had overcome the World,</hi> but <hi>through death</hi> the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle tells us <hi>he deſtroyed him that had the power of death,</hi> and as there was two different diſpenſations then, in the reſtoration of man, they ſtill continue, and the latter is as contrary to the former as that of our Lord was unto <hi>Moſes,</hi> in the firſt we are Servants and if faithful we are ſo far from denying a
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:98376:31"/>change of diſpenſation that we daily wait for it, that we may give an account of the Improvement of the Tallent; for in that ſtands a change of the diſpenſation, the firſt State has life and death ſet before it, with a Promiſe of a reward or Puniſhment according as the creature is faithful or other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, and as faithful receive the good from time to time but as we do cooperate with the Tallent, this reaches no fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther then the Covenant of works, and as it can not make per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect as to the new and Heavenly Man, 'tis needful to know what can; and that is the true knowledge of the miſtery of Chriſts death in the fleſh, for that perfectly reconciles unto God, by which the one Offering is known that perfects for ever them that are ſanctified, for there only can the Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker be freely offered up unto God wholly for a burnt Offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, as a free Sacrifice, and then <hi>to die with Chriſt to the fleſh is gain,</hi> thus is the Death of the Saints pleaſant in the eyes of the Lord, it being the Sweeteſt Sacrifice becauſe <hi>the more they die the more they live to God,</hi> this was the State the Apoſtle ſo much vallued as he eſteemed <hi>to know nothing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt them but Chriſt and him Crucified, and to be made confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mable to his Death</hi> was his <hi>chief deſire, that if poſſible he might attain to the reſurrection of the dead,</hi> you ſee he was ſo far from limitting the diſpenſations of God to what he did know as he did not limit or ſeem to bound them ſhort of attaining to the Reſurrection of the dead.</p>
            <p>And of this change of diſpenſation, we have a Figure in <hi>Abrams offering up of Iſaac,</hi> God promiſed him a Son, he cooperated with the Promiſe to bring forth <hi>Iſaac;</hi> that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing done, that there might be a diſtinction betwixt Work and Grace, tho its true if we ſpeak generally all Gods deal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with Man to bring him unto himſelf is Grace, and thus the leaſt meaſure given to profit with is truly Grace, but when we diſtinguiſh with reſpects to the work of God in Man by which the reſtoration is brought about and recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciliation
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:98376:31"/>wrought the latter is termed grace as oppoſed to that of Works, and that this diſtinction might be clear <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi> muſt offer up <hi>Iſaac</hi> in whom the Promiſe ſtood, it was his all, and therefore in the offering of him up, the Ram the begetter or worker was diſcover'd behind the Buſh, <hi>who was there before but not ſeen till now,</hi> but as ſoon as ſeen how gladly did <hi>Abram</hi> offer up the Ram to God wholly for a burnt Offering, O how gladly did <hi>Abraham</hi> part with the Ram, with the Worker and how eaſily when he ſaw that was all that was intended <hi>in this great tryal,</hi> and now <hi>Iſaac</hi> is receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the grace in the Second Covenant, and now and not before can it only be truly ſaid, <hi>'tis no more of work leaſt any man ſhould boaſt,</hi> no this act excludes the boaſting and the boaſter for ever, and as this throughly reconciles unto God ſo it perfectly deſtroyes the enmity, that ariſes about Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, and Ceremony, or about the Formallies of Form on a Religious ſcore, the firſt part of the work ſhuts out <hi>Iſhmael</hi> the Enemy <hi>as an evil doer,</hi> but the latter act ſhuts out or deſtroyes him <hi>as a Serpent,</hi> wherein he keeps up the enmities amongſt the ſeveral profeſſors of Religion; <hi>under the ſhew or likeneſs of Good, and ſo make Religion which ſhould be the very cauſe of good will and Peace, to be cauſe of en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity and ſtrife;</hi> and this deceives poor Man, and if we were but Spiritually minded the Scripture would be found to be writ for our Learning and comfort, and is as applicable in Spiritual ſenſe now as then in the Letter, wherein the Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony as well as the excellency appears. But the chief difference that we find in the diſpenſations (ſave that thoſe were more outward, and theſe now are more inward) is, that what was then done in <hi>Iſrael,</hi> as a people or a Society, every particular or individual Men ought to wait to know done in and for himſelf, for <hi>Iſrael</hi> in the fleſh came through thoſe various ſtates as Figures to Us; for Inſtance they were all in <hi>Egypt,</hi> paſſed through the Sea, received the
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:98376:32"/>Law, travelled the Wilderneſs, paſſed <hi>Jordan,</hi> and entred <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naan</hi> together; but 'tis not ſo now with any Society; and ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing no Society on the account of Religion can be in one and the ſame State together, that Society that is the trueſt Figure of the univerſal Church of God muſt take in all thoſe vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous States that <hi>fear God and work Righteouſneſs,</hi> therefore a right Goſpel Church, with reſpect to outward Society, is a comprehenſive Church, and cannot ſhut out for Opinion; which deſerves your moſt ſerious conſideration, in relation to your Brethren at leaſt.</p>
            <p>But to apply what has been ſaid to our caſe; as it is ſure that every Man, that comes truly to be reconciled unto God, muſt know the diſpenſation changed in his Age; ſo 'tis as certain that what is to be done in one Man, ought to be done in all Men, and muſt be done in all, that comes truly to know the new and heavenly Man put on; but ſeeing this cannot be done in all at one time, as we are a Society, it muſt at leaſt be done in our Elders or Leaders, or 'tis not poſſible that we ſhould be as a Society, a true Figure of the Univerſal Church of God. For as are the Elders or Leaders, ſo is the People in a great meaſure that depend on them; and therefore if our Leaders have narrow Spirits and wrong Notions of things; the People muſt be ſo too, whereupon in followes if our Leaders deny a change of Diſpenſation and ceaſe to travel, the People muſt needs do ſo too, and therefore whileſt our Elders and Leaders know not a Change of Diſpenſation in this Age, which is, a coming through the miſtery of Chriſts Death, and a dying with Chriſt to the fleſh, by which the beauty of External things paſſeth away in the true Miniſtration of Life, as ſuch cannot <hi>be dead with Chriſt to the Rudiments of the World,</hi> they will be burthened with their Opinions and Ordinances, and therein burthen others. We intreat you to Conſider of this; for it was and is on this very foot, that the greateſt part of all Religious Societies have fail'd;
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:98376:32" rendition="simple:additions"/>wherein their Leaders and Elders were allwayes moſt in fault. For they could allow of no variation or change of Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſation but what they made themſelves; and is not this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of fact? and therefore allwayes miſſed of the mind of God, both as he appear'd by his Son and by his Servants; it has been thus through all the Reformation, and was thus in that great example of <hi>Iſrael;</hi> for thô they received the Law to prepare, as <hi>a Schoolmaſter to bring unto Chriſt,</hi> and did pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to look for him, yet could not allow of the change of Diſpenſation that he brought, ſo ſticking in their own Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions and Judgements of things, in ſtead of receiving him, that ſhould have perfected the work they had known begun, they rejected him, for they ſaid, <hi>had any of the Rulers</hi> (that is Elders and Leaders,) <hi>believed? But the People that knew not the Law were accurſed.</hi> And thoſe were ſuch as ſeem'd to have a great eſteem for the Law, the firſt part of the work, yet <hi>taught for Doctrines the Commandments of men;</hi> by which the People were alſo miſled that depended on them; and whileſt you deny a change of Diſpenſation in this, Age, 'tis clear you ſtick in your own Opinions and Judgments, and are as truly in danger to miſs the mind of God and miſlead others, as any that have been before you.</p>
            <p>But obſerve, for you know, or at leaſt may, that whileſt our Lord was in the fleſh he was tyed unto the <hi>Jews,</hi> or however did appear ſo, and here he ſeem'd ſtraitned or limited with reſpect to the reſt of Mankind; but when he had ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filled the work given him to do, as he dyed to the fleſh of the <hi>Jew</hi> he became univerſal, <hi>giving Gentiles as well as Jews an enterance unto the Father by one Spirit, and of twain made one New Man,</hi> and <hi>caſt off the ſeed of</hi> Abraham <hi>after the fleſh, and chuſed his ſeed after the Spirit, from hence he took off all confidence in the fleſh;</hi> for if the <hi>Jews</hi> had not herein to truſt, ſurely no Society now can have wherein to truſt on that account.</p>
            <pb n="64" facs="tcp:98376:33" rendition="simple:additions"/>
            <p> But the Apoſtle tells us, <hi>if the caſting off the Jews was the riches of the World, what ſhould be their receiving, but as life from the dead?</hi> And which way could this great benefit come un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Mankind in their receiving <gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="1 span">
                  <desc>〈…〉</desc>
               </gap> more then in this; that as then they ſhould have known true reconci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liation unto God, they would have been acquainted with the various States that are to be paſſed through before that can be known; and then as they would have been truly fitted to have informed Mankind of the different effects of each, ſo their credit with all that had received Chriſt would have given them that advantage to have been believed; then ſhould we have been truly informed, that generally ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the work of God in reſtoring Man unto himſelf was really twofold? and that the firſt part, tho a glorious work, yet it was but to prepare and not to perfect; and as it was but to prepare, there was a neceſſity to wait to know the Diſpenſation changed. For had the <hi>Jews,</hi> as a Society received the Meſſiah, they would then have known him, to inlarge them in the Spirit, by taking away the confidence in the fleſh; then with one voice they would have infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med us, that whileſt they continued in the firſt part of the work, thô it was glorious, yet their Spirits was narrow and ſhut up to the reſt of Mankind, and their thoughts was chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſh and partial toward God; for they did conclude, that becauſe God had done ſo much for them, he had either forgotten or rejected all others, but receiving the Meſſiah as they would have known the Diſpenſation changed ſo they would have been inlarged in Spirit; then would they have informed us, <hi>that God was God of the Gentile as well as of the Jew,</hi> and that as <hi>he was Lord over all, ſo he was rich unto all that in truth called upon his Name;</hi> this would have morti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied and ſlain all our ſtrife about Forms, carnal Ordinances, Opinion and Ceremony; but alas in ſtead of coming as a Body or Society from the Form to the Power, coming out
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:98376:33"/>of or through the firſt Covenant Works and from under a Legal Diſpenſation, wherein the confidence in the fleſh ſtood, as well as the warrs and ſtrife, into the Second Covenant, in to the miniſtration of Life, where the good will and Peace is; that ſo they might have been a perfect Figure of the work of God with Man and therein been the <hi>great example</hi> to the World, as well of Gods Love and good will, as of that Righteouſneſs and Juſtice which he required; they ſtuck in the firſt part of the work; and ſo that <hi>Elect and Pretious Stone,</hi> that laid in <hi>Sion, became to them a ſtumbling Stone and Rock of Offence,</hi> for tho they ſeemed to own and magnifie <hi>Moſes</hi> and the Prophets diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſation, which God owned and appointed, yet not owning the Change of Diſpenſation in the Meſſiah, they became as a Sect, too narrow in their Minds and Spirits, to make known the good unto Mankind in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended in their chuſing; for the caſting them off ſingly was not the riches of the World; but becauſe they ſtuck in the fleſh, and could not follow the Lord fully, as their Father <hi>Abram</hi> did, to manifeſt the good, they muſt be caſten off or elſe it could not have been known, thus it is clear they was rejected and caſten off becauſe they denyed the Change of Diſpenſation, which ſhould have inlarged them in Spirit, to have been the <hi>bleſſing of Nations.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Pray conſider if ſomething of this hath not attended all the Reformations according to their reſpective Intereſt; they could never as a body receive thoſe further appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ances of God teſtifyed unto by ſuch as the Lord ſent and and made uſe of; and therefore ſtuck in a fleſhly knowledg of what they firſt knew or received, like the <hi>Jews,</hi> which tho good in it ſelf ſo far as it reacht, but not conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that as God has done great things for them, he could ſtill do greater, they durſt never truſt him in the deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up of the Tallent therefore in ſtead of becoming more
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:98376:34"/>Spiritual, they ſtuck in the fleſh; ſo that we may ſee in ſome ſort what is of Man comes to be manifeſted in a So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety which is one body on a religious ſcore, and that is fleſh and Spirit, which can never be reconciled, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the one muſt prevail, and accordingly as they prevail that body may be denominated, but in particular Perſons we have ſeen the fleſh overcom'd and that <hi>univerſallity of Spirit</hi> brought forth teſtified too in the birth of Chriſt, yet tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly there wants the Example in a body or Society of Men, ſo needful ſo neceſſary for the honour of God, and the Peace of Mankind; and from hence have come thoſe ſeperations and Diviſions that have been and muſt continue <hi>till Shilo come.</hi> And now you are upon the Stage, and more may be expected from you then others, by how much you con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude God to have done more for you then others; and as you pretend more unto the Spirit then others. If then you do reſemble <hi>Spiritual Iſrael</hi> more then others, you muſt wait to place your Unity not upon the Profeſſor of the Truth, for he may be but as the fleſhly child of <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,</hi> but upon the Poſſeſſor, and upon all travelling for <hi>Sion,</hi> tho ſo ignorant of the way, that they weep becauſe they know it no better. For 'tis thoſe and not the former that <hi>follow the Lord where ever he leads,</hi> and thoſe he will own for ever, whether they be known unto the World or worldly Profeſſors, or not, he knowes them, and is ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thering them together in one, by deſtroying the enmity as it ſtands in carnal Ordinances; and doth declare now, as he did by his Apoſtle that <hi>of every Nation thoſe that fear God and work righteouſneſs are accepted of him;</hi> and what is accepted of God ought to be accepted of Man; and therefore if you conceive you are Leaders (not of <hi>Iſrael</hi> in the fleſh, but of <hi>Iſrael in the Spirit,</hi> you muſt know your Spirits inlarged, that you may own what God owns; for <hi>as our Principal is univerſal, our good will ought to be as
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:98376:34"/>large to the Children of Men,</hi> for conſider, <hi>an <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſal principle and a narrow limited Spirit are inconſiſtant.</hi> But this can never be without a change of the Diſpenſation come, you know <hi>Iſrael</hi> after the fleſh was to allow the <hi>Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile</hi> to worſhip God in the outward Court. Pray mind then if their outward Court was not larger then ours? 'Tis true they had an inward Court, that ſuch could not come to, till Circumciſed; was there then an outward Court, and an inward; and have not we what anſwers to them now? What is ſit for the Society of good Men, may not that very well be allowed to come into our Society or out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Court? For they who do not come thus farr, cannot come into the inward Court, yet ſeeing they muſt come to the outward before the inward, ſhall not we al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low them here? Teſtifying at the ſame time to the Inward Court, which none can come to but <hi>by the true Circumci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion in Spirit.</hi> Thus it is clear, if our Outward Court were but a little more large, our Inward Court would cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly be the more prized vallued and ſought after. Again you know the Leader in <hi>Iſrael,</hi> in their Travel from <hi>Egypt</hi> to <hi>Canaan,</hi> was to Travel according to the leaſt of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and did allwayes own ſuch as were Circumciſed, tho at eight dayes old to be of the Church of God in the Figure; and pray will not this hold as true to Spiritual <hi>Iſrael?</hi> What is Circumciſion in the fleſh now but a holy Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation performed in the fear of God? For as this is ſo far accepted of God it really fits for the Society of good men, and therefore its impoſſible it ſhould be rejected of that People or Society or Church that is a true Figure of the Church of God; now leaſt you ſhould run this into an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tream, we will at preſent bound it with reſpect to your Brethen, <hi>who have come out and ſuffered with you for the Teſtimony of a good Conſcience, and do yet in your own ſenſe agree with you in the worſhip and Doctrines of truth;</hi> and
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:98376:35"/>yet for all this are ſhut out and excluded by you, for not complying with you in your Opinions, yea meer Opinions; for that they are ſuch, is put out of doubt, when you tell us, <hi>thoſe things of Difference do not relate to Faith, Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience or Religion.</hi> We beſeech you to be ſerious, for this evidently makes manifeſt the narrowneſs of your Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, and that narrowneſs of Spirit demonſtrates a neceſſity for you to know a change of the Diſpenſation. For 'tis impoſſible whiles you thus remain that you ſhould be that Figure of the true Church, to which the gathering can be, by bringing forth <hi>that peace on Earth that good will to Men, and glory to God on high;</hi> where only <hi>the Swords are beaten into Plowſhares, and Spears into Pruning Hookes;</hi> 'tis this and the glory of this, to which the gathering of the People muſt be; we ſaw ſomething of this in our coming forth, as our teſtimony againſt all force, wrath and ſighting with carnal weapons do teſtifie.</p>
            <p>But alas! Not truly travelling in Spirit to know the work compleated, we have not yet come to know the ſubſtance of what was ſeen in the Viſion, without which the other will prove but as a dead and Formal buſineſs. Nor can you know this without a change of the diſpenſation, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore whiles you conclude againſt it in your mind, it is clear to us, you ſtick in the works of a firſt Covenant, and abide but under a Legal Diſpenſation, and tho you ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear to be againſt the Enemy as <hi>as an evil doer,</hi> that is no more then others have done before you; but not knowing the Diſpenſation changed; tho the Enemy does not attach you with what is evil and Immoral, yet he deceives you as a Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent, as is apparent in this noiſe you make about your Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions, and further clear in this Narrowneſs of Spirit that appears amongſt you, as is amongſt the various pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſors of Religion, that except you wait to know the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſation changed, the Serpent will beguile you as he has
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:98376:35"/>done others; forin that appearance he cannot be deſtroyed; but as we come in to the Death of Chriſt to the fleſh and know the Miſtery of it. We intreat you to conſider of thoſe things ſeriouſly and in the fear of God, that the good will and love that is known in the writing thoſe things may be felt; and then tho much might be ſaid about this matter, yet may this ſuffice, but if in ſtead of conſidering them, you will conteſt them by your cunning; then if the Lord ſee't meet, more may be ſaid; but in the intrim this may ſerve.</p>
            <p>As little as this Book is, many more things might be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected againſt; we ſhall chiefly take notice of one paſſage more in the 11. <hi>Page</hi> and with it conclude; <hi>it followes</hi> (ſayes our Author) <hi>I would therefore beſeech you Friends to ponder it in your own minds upon what a narrow point your diſtance ſtands, and that the main and tender point is allowed you,</hi> viz. <hi>Conſcience is free and unconcern'd in the queſtion and the viſible ground of Difference being ſo ſmall weigh with your ſelves by what has been, what may be the conſequence of this lamentable breach,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſwer,</hi> As little as this diſtance is made by you, we do not find it fairly ſet out; we will indeavour to ſet it forth as it is without any reſerve, that we may come to a clear Iſſue with you in the matter; and firſt wee'l take no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice how farr we agree in your ſenſe according to your con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſions in this <hi>Epiſtle,</hi> that ſo a better and clearer Judgment may be made of the difference (<hi>Page</hi> the 2) you grant <hi>we are one in Judgment with you in the Worſhip and Doctrines of truth;</hi> therefore in thoſe Eſſential Points we cannot differ in your ſenſe, which we deſire may be noted for the future. Further you ſay, <hi>We own the end,</hi> that is, of good Order in the Society, for that muſt be intended or nothing; and not only ſo but you ſay, <hi>We allow of the means, which can be no leſs then ſuch fitting Method; as may anſwer that end,

Thus in your own ſenſe, if you are ingenious, in your confeſſions, we cannot want what is eſſential to demonſtrate our Duty to God or Men: We own Women are concern'd in Converſation, having Souls to ſave as well as Men; we allow they may Meet apart from Men on ſome diſtinct occaſions; we Impoſe no new Oppinion nor obtrude any new Method in Diſcipline; You neither do nor have any thing to charge us with that is Immoral or evil; Pray then let not the Bear skin be put on us for the future let things appear as they are.</p>
            <p>For on your part 'tis clear that you make the difference to ſtand and ariſe from thoſe things, which under the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Elders you have brought in and exhorted to; we Joyn Iſſue with you here, and ſay 'tis true, the difference ſtand here as to matter of fact, or what does externally ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear; but we ſay our Disſatisfaction is deeper; it is with that Spirit and Power, that without reſerve requires complience with what under the notion of Elders you exhort too; it is here we place the ground of our Difference and Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſatisfaction: We intreat you to be ſerious: for we moſt ſurely believe, that the allowing in our caſe ſuch a power to Man under the Notion of Elderſhip begets and leads into an Implicit reverence and blind obedience, and ſo directly leads into Ignorance and ſlavery: And <hi>as the firſt is incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtent with the true knowledge of our Lord and Saviour Jeſus Chriſt; ſo is the latter with that freedom we ought to Injoy, as we are a free and voluntary Society.</hi> Now we ſay, had you practiſed Womens Meetings, as believing a Service in them, and only recommended them to be uſed as a Service was found, we believe we ſhould not have open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly oppoſed; hoping as the liberty of examination <hi>(the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubted right of every true Chriſtian)</hi> had been truly and conſcientiouſly preſerved by you; things that had been wrong would have dyed of themſelves, but when inſtead of
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:98376:36"/>recommending, you injoyn, &amp; when in ſtead of leaving things to be freely examined, you add all the force and skill you have to uphold them, no way is left for us to ſtand clear in our Conſciences to God; <hi>but in ſtanding faſt in that free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom and liberty our Lord has purchaſed for us;</hi> nor any other way have we left to indeavour to undeceive you and others, but by ſhewing our disſatisfaction. For to be ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent here, is to give conſent; and what ſtrengthens wrong, can never take it away. Meeting therefore with this Power that is wrong exerted in this of Womens Meetings, its here then the difference muſt ſtand as to matter of fact; and as the allowing of this Power does in our Judgment and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding (as above) bring in Ignorance and ſlavery, therefore we ſay if the things might be of ſome ſervice in ſome places, yet to Impoſe them univerſally upon the Society is wrong, and we are in Conſcience bound to refuſe them, as againſt the truth, and diſtructive to our Chriſtian Freedom, as it ſtands in the Liberty of Exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination and choice. Therefore though the thing cannot be ſaid to be ſimply evil in it ſelfe, yet the conſequence is evil, <hi>and we are bound to ſhun and avoid the appearance of evil as well as the evil it ſelf.</hi> Thus the Iſſue of this great buſineſs muſt ſtand as ſtated <hi>Page</hi> 20. and 21. that is, <hi>there muſt be a neceſſity for thoſe things that you bring in againſt your Brethrens conſent, or you muſt ſet forth that you have a right under the Notion of Elders to Impoſe upon the Society that for which in truth there is no neceſſity.</hi> For now we ſay in plain words there is no Neceſſity for Womens conſtant diſtinct Meeting for Government in our Societies, and deny that you have any Power lodged in you under the Notion of Elderſhip, by Virtue of our conſtitution, to bring or Impoſe upon Us that which in truth there is no Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity for.</p>
            <p>Firſt, that there is no neceſſity for Womens Meetings as
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:98376:37"/>above, is clear from the Practice of Friends, whiles we had them not, as well as from the Practiſe of ſuch now as have them not, and yet owns the ſame Principle: Again, the Practice of all Chriſtians from the beginning demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate there can be no neceſſity for them in a general way, as inſiſted on by you. For if there had been a neceſſity for them to Order or Government, they could not have been without them; ſeeing what there is a neceſſity for, is <hi>as</hi> Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſential to the being of that thing. But 'tis matter of fact, that they have all done, the buſineſs of their reſpective So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cieties without this Mode contended for by you, therefore we may ſafely conclude there can be no neceſſity for Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mens conſtant and diſtinct Meetings for Government in our Society; and indeed if things are brought in to the Society againſt the minds of your Brethren, by which dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference ariſes, nothing can juſtifie the proceeding on your part but a neceſſity for the thing. For if this of Neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty be not conſider'd in our caſe as abounder, a door is o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened to fill us with Opinions and Ceremony, ſeeing there wants nothing to introduce them but a ſpecious Pretence, which never fail'd to wait on ſuch as affect Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, or reflect on their own abillities for it. Now as there can be no neceſſity for Womens conſtant Meeting for Government, for you to claim Power, under the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Elders to bring in to the Society againſt the minds of your Brethren ſuch things as in truth there is no Neceſſity for, this we ſay is a violence done to our Conſtitution, as we imbodied a free and voluntary Society and is alſo againſt the truth of our Principle and Opinion.</p>
            <p>Firſt, that it is a violence to our Conſtitution is clear for you know in our coming forth we did not chooſe any Elders to depend on, nor indeed could we according to our Profeſſion; for as we aſſerted <hi>that Chriſt our Lord was come in Spirit to teach and govern us, a teacher that as he
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:98376:37"/>could not be removed into a corner, ſo he was only ſufficient.</hi> And therefore the preheminence was to be given to him in all things. Thus it would have been a gainſt his Honour, and the truth of what we profeſſed, to have choſen any Man to have depended upon; when Chriſt was come in Spirit to teach and govern, to depend on Man to do it, was to neglect the Fountain and chuſe the Ciſtern; therefore as we neither did nor could, according to the truth of our Principle, chuſe any Men to depend on, under any Name or Notion whatſoever, for any to chuſe or Impoſe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves upon Us, is wrong to Us, and a violence offered to our Conſtitution. For in ſhort, obſerve; <hi>it is really Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of the ſufficiency of Chriſt to chuſe any Man ſo much as Men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally to depend on.</hi> But 'tis Slavery to have others to chuſe for or Impoſe themſelves or their choice upon Us. You know as Chriſt our Lord was own'd to be come in Spirit to teach and Govern us, we were to bring all our thoughts words and deeds to him, that we might know the truth in what we thought ſaid or did; for we were not to be our own but his; and as we were to bring our own words and deeds to him, certainly we were to bring the words and deeds of all others to him in which we were to be concernd. For as we could not know the truth of what we did our ſelves, but by the teſtimony or approbation of his Spirit, ſo 'tis beyond contradiction we can not know the words and deeds of others to be from the truth any other way; thus conviction or perſwaſion brought us toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and that muſt be preſerved ſtill inviolably, or we can not continue a free People, examination of what we were to receive from others was truly aſſerted, as our undoubted right in our coming forth, and as the truth is but one, the reaſon is the ſame now as well as then, therefore to Impoſe an Elderſhip upon Us under any pretence whatſoever, as it deſtroyes or takes away the Liberty of Examination, 'tis a
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:98376:38"/>violence done to our Conſtitution. Indeed what is brought in by violence muſt needs be upheld by force, or otherwiſe it will dye and come to nothing of it ſelf; thus the force and ſtrife you have uſed to uphold what you have brought in by violence demonſtrate you more wrong then any argument we can uſe; when 'tis but ſeriouſly conſidered, that it is not Truth but Error that loſes by tryal; nay the truth only gains the moſt when freely examined and tryed, and error loſes moſt that way; what can diſcover your wrongneſs more then the denying a free Examination? For where that is taken away the prevailing of thoſe things cannot be owing to the truth, but the force and conqueſt of Men; which as it is directly contrary to a free examination and choice, ſo 'tis beyond contradiction a violence done to our Conſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on as we are a free and volluntary Society <hi>confeſſing but one Lord and head.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And as the bringing into our Society things for which there appear no neceſſity, and requiring complyance under the no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Elderſhip, is a Violence done to our Conſtitution; ſo 'tis againſt the truth of our Principle &amp; Profeſſion. For you know, <hi>the Lord from Heaven the ſecond</hi> Adam, <hi>the quickning Spirit, the true Light that lighteth all Men coming into the World is Profeſſed to be our foundation and aſſerted by us to be ſufficient to lead into all truth all that truly adhere to him.</hi> Now it muſt follow, whileſt we thus confeſs him, that we truly adhere to him, or we do not, if we truly adhere to him, we muſt according to the truth of what we profeſs know his ſufficiency, <hi>and where the ſufficiency of Chriſt our Lord is truly known ſuch can not depend on Man,</hi> no 'tis Impoſſible, as in the Natural Figure, the Moon and Starrs do ſhew us light, but 'tis in the dark, 'tis in the night; therefore when the Sun comes, thô it does not take away that light, which the Moon and Stares have as to themſelves, yet to us it takes it away, ſo that it is impoſſible, thô we had a mind to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:98376:38"/>on that Light or have any benefit from it; and we are ſure the Sun of righteouſneſs, as he ariſes in the Soul, doth as much fulfill the Service and tranſcend the light of the Inſtrument; therefore on this foot we are to call no Man Doctor, Maſter, Father or Elder on Earth by way of Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heminence for our dependance; <hi>becauſe one is our Doctor, Maſter, Father, and Elder in Heaven;</hi> and all ſuch as are thus taught of him are Brethren; Chriſt and his Diſciples in the dayes of his fleſh are a true Figure of this; for he choſe his Diſciples they did not chuſe him; and as he choſe them out of the World they was ſimply to depend upon him, not one upon another; therefore when they thought of depending one upon another by conſulting <hi>who ſhould be the greateſt amongſt them,</hi> our Lord corrected their miſtake and in them yours, if you lay claim to the like choice, by telling them <hi>the Elder ſhould be as the Younger, and he that rul'd as he that ſerved,</hi> nay, <hi>he that would be the greateſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong them, muſt be Servant to all the reſt;</hi> then not Lord or Maſter to Impoſe upon the reſt; and as he told them they <hi>ſhould call no Man Maſter, Doctor or Father,</hi> ſo he forbad them to be called <hi>ſoe;</hi> and we are ſure it was the thing, as well as the Name, that was intended; whereupon it followes, that to ſeek this Preheminence by deſiring this dependance under the Notion of Elderſhip, as it is contrary to the truth of our Principle and Profeſſion, ſo 'tis againſt the very Sence and meaning of the Command of our Lord and Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour Jeſus Chriſt. For this is to come in your own Name and not in his.</p>
            <p>But on the other hand, whilſt we confeſs <hi>the Lord is come to teach and govern,</hi> if we do not truly adhere to him, as ſuch can not know the truth of what they do profeſs, ſo 'tis cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain ſuch do not truly believe in him; and if ſuch think that want ſhall be ſupplyed by depending upon you; or that this is Chriſts Government, to be ſubject unto yours, they
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:98376:39" rendition="simple:additions"/>are Miſerably miſtaken. And truly whilſt you ſeek this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendance under the Notion of Elderſhip, you contribute to their miſtake and are guilty of the Ignorance and Error ſuch are in; for as (in the Figure above) the Diſciples were not to gather unto themſelves, but unto their Lord, knowing none could be truly taught except they came to him, ſo they knew that if they did come to him, he was ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient, and therefore having brought 'em to him they did not interpoſe, <hi>We have found the Meſſiah</hi> ſaid one, <hi>Jeſus of</hi> Nazareth, can any good come out of <hi>Nazareth? Come and ſee, try thy ſelfe, and then thou'l have the ſame ground to truſt that we have,</hi> or to this effect; and tis true according to our Profeſſion, that <hi>Chriſt our Lord is now as able to teach, and may be now as eaſily come to as then;</hi> who is it then that dare ſtrive for their Opinions, whileſt ſuch acknowledge the Lord is preſent? Thus if you were the Servants of Chriſt you muſt gather to him, and not to your ſelves; for we can not be the Diſciples of Chriſt till we hear him our ſelves, nor followers of him till we know him go before us, and this we can not truly know whileſt we depend on you or any Man. True Religion is founded on thoſe two Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands, <hi>to love God with all our heart and our Neighbour as our ſelves;</hi> here's both our Duty to God and Men included; and Chriſt our Lord teacheth the latter as well as the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer; and thoſe that know not ſomething of the truth of thoſe things in their own minds, under our Profeſſion are not yet come in to the School of Chriſt. Pray therefore let the People know that as Chriſt is head to the true Churh in all things, he muſt be head to every Man in all things, that is a Member of this Church: So that to be of this Church is quite another thing then to be of any <gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> Socie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty whatever, (<hi>Addreſs to</hi> Proteſtants <hi>Page</hi> 177) this build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing is rear'd without noiſe ſtrife and contention; 'tis like its Figure the Temple built at <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> in <hi>Solomons Peaceful
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:98376:39"/>Reign</hi> no Axe or Hammer heard there; all that at beſt is but in the Preparation, which ſo many have miſtaken for the choice: And ſo in ſtead of travelling for the true reſt have ſet up a falſe one, growing great in ſtead of being humble, diſpiſing others in overvalluing themſelves. For all this noiſe and ſtrife in the beſt ſenſe is amongſt the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants and Workmen, amongſt the drawers of Water, and hewers of Wood, and not among the Children and Sons of God. Now your Service if you have any is to bring to Chriſt, the true knowledge of him ends the ſtrife and the noiſe. For thoſe that ſit at his feet truly to hear him are quiet, and as they have choſen the better part, ſoe are they not cumbred about many things. And as your Service is to bring to him, you ought to indeavour honeſtly to take out of the way whatever hinders coming to him, and indeed in this caſe, that is your own ſelf hood, your affected and deſired Elderſhips for this is to bear witneſs to your ſelves, by ſeeking a relyance and dependance upon you, and this be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gets into Sects and Diviſions; for 'tis ſure while the People depend on you ot any Man, they neither do nor can know the ſufficiency of Chriſt our Lord. Pray therefore con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider, that to ſeek this dependance upon you under the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Elderſhip is really againſt the truth of our Principle and Profeſſion. For if you prevail it will fix the People in that which can never perfect, for all that depend on you, as they muſt allwayes be learning of you, ſuch can never be able <hi>to know the truth as it is in Jeſus;</hi> as it allwayes falls out where Perſons on a Religious ſcore ſeek to bear Rule by their own means, and the People love to have it ſo; and as on this foot you will ſtill grow more narrow in your minds and Spirits, as true and juſt a ſeperation may be from you as any other People heretofore. We intreat you to weigh the matter, that ſo you may throw down your Crowns at the feet of Jeſus, <hi>who alone is worthy to raign,</hi> according to our Teſtimony in our beginning.</p>

            <p> 
               <hi>Objection,</hi> But perhaps you will ſay, <hi>It is true Chriſt our Lord is ſufficient for all that truly adhere to him; but all that Profeſs him do not adhere to him, and 'tis for their Souls that an Elderſhip is neceſſary, and that we are thus concerned that a check may be upon all Practice, as an expediency againſt Irregularity in Converſation, whether toward them that are without, or them that are within the ſame Communion, to which the ſtrong will ſubmit for the ſake of the Weak,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Page the</hi> 9.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſwer,</hi> It ſeems your care is about thoſe that do not truly adhere to Chriſt, and for the ſecuring of them; you ought to be cautious that you do not burthen the Conſcience of thoſe that are faithful, for if what is good and evil could not be known and Judged of without Womens Meetings for Government, it were ſomething to the purpoſe; but ſince it is clear it may, this ſeems but an Artifice to ſeek to inſlave ſuch as are conſcientious and ſincere to God, under pretence of taking care for thoſe that are not; and is but a ſubtill argument to make way for the ſetting up Mans Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment in ſtead of Chriſts; for what is this but to ſay we are not to examine what you bring in whiles yon pretend to apply it to ſome good end? But if we do examin things and truly find they tend to Formallity and leads into Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance and Slavery, yet we muſt diſſemble our conviction and diſhonour our head to pleaſe you, whats this but to endeavour to make us owe more to you for Government then we do to the Civil Magiſtrate? 'Tis true <hi>We are to Obey every Ordinance of Man for the Lords ſake,</hi> but yet we do not this blindfold; for as we are the Servants of Chriſt, and own him for our Lord and Head, we muſt examine what Man Injoyns, and if in our underſtanding it agrees with the truth we are bound in Conſcience to obey: But if it do not, then Conſcience rather obliges to ſuffer then diſhonour our Head. And will you not allow us that berty without making us ſuffer, which you take and inſiſt
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:98376:40"/>upon as a right. You know <hi>Chriſt our Lord is one in all,</hi> and cannot deny but that <hi>he ought to be the Head of every Man,</hi> and where he is truly head, we affirm, ſuch can do no leſs with reſpect to his Honour, then examine what they are to receive, and to be ſingular here, or of the leſſer numbers is ſo farr from being wrong or a hazzard, that it is only juſt and ſafe. But perhaps you will Object, <hi>ſhall not the evil doer be dealt with?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>We Anſwer Yes; for as we have granted this before we here confirm it; but then, who is this evil doer, ought to be conſidered. For you know, <hi>you ought</hi> (according to <hi>Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſs to</hi> Proteſtants (<hi>Page</hi> 99) <hi>to make no other diſtinction of good and evil then God has made;</hi> it followes then <hi>you ſhall know them by their fruits</hi> (ſayes Chriſt) <hi>So</hi> (ſay you) <hi>ſhall Men know them that ſincerely believe, and confeſs Chriſt by their ſanctified Manners, and blameleſs Converſation, and</hi> (mark) <hi>Woe unto them that make other diſtinctions</hi> (pray mind it,) <hi>for God has made no other.</hi> (again) <hi>there will be but Goats and Sheep at the laſt, Holy and unholy, Juſt and unjuſt; therefore</hi> (ſay you) <hi>let that be our diſtinction</hi> (obſerve it) <hi>which ever was and will be Gods diſtinction; for all other meaſures</hi> (pray mind) <hi>are the effects of the Paſſions and Preſumptions of Men.</hi> Pray apply it; and, if you can but give what you have aſſerted to be right to receive, Contention will be laid aſleep among us, for had you made no other diſtinctions then God has made, we'd had no difference.</p>
            <p>But again, perhaps you will ſay, <hi>this is to make void the Service of Inſtruments and to deny an Elderſhip in the Church of Chriſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſwer,</hi> No we truly own both in a right ſenſe, but we ſay the Service of thoſe Inſtruments that the Lord ſends are to be fulfilled on a Spiritual account, and therefore <hi>ſuch as come in the Name of Chriſt; gather to him and not unto themſelves;</hi> for like their Maſter they bear witneſs to the truth and make
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:98376:41"/>themſelves of no Reputation, throwing their Crowns down conſtantly at the feet of their Lord, affirming freely as well as truly that their Service muſt be fulfilled for Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs ſake by every one that comes to know the Lord preſent and ſufficient. For where Chriſt takes the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment the Service of the Inſtrument is ſwallowed up; and therefore muſt as really decreaſe, as in the <hi>Baptiſt's</hi> time; and they that do not Preach it as well as he know not that ſelf denyal he taught; <hi>and yet the leaſt in the Kingdom is greater then he.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And as to Elders, they are ſuch as are more grown up in the knowledge of our Lord and Saviour Jeſus Chriſt then others are, and 'tis true their Service is to go Armed before their Brethren, in Order to lead them into reſt, which their Souls have taſted of; and by bringing them into that State, that their Service might be diſcharged, ſuch ſeek not then to ſet it up as perpetual, but to have it finiſhed; of this we have a Figure in thoſe of <hi>Iſrael</hi> that received the Lot of their Inheritance, before they paſs'd over <hi>Jordan,</hi> yet were they ſtrong Men to go Armed before their Brethren, but it was as their Servants not as their Maſters. For they was not to be followed but as they were the followers of <hi>Joſhua</hi> the Figure of the true Jeſus; and here both them that did follow, and them that went before did know that their Service of going before was to be fulfilled and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged, ſo that as the one part did truly deſire reſt, that they ſhould have no occaſion for their Brethren's Service, ſo did the other both deſire and expect it, that they might be diſcharged of it; and this is a true Figure of the Elderſhip in Chriſt. For indeed as ſuch are more grown up into the Nature and Spirit of our Lord, by ſo much they do the more reſemble him in his ſelfdenyal humility and Service. So that tho they go Armed before their Brethren, yet they freely affirm their Brethren are not to follow them, but as
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:98376:41"/>they are the followers of Chriſt; and all true followers of ſuch Elders might have a meaſure of the ſame Spirit; therefore all ſuch Elders direct to the Spirit of Truth. For without that they can neither be truly known or followed. But ſuch Elders like their Maſter makes little Figure in the World, and therefore cannot be known aright but in a Spiritual way, and are as little known as followed. But that the Practices of ſuch may be the better known, we will remind you of what you have recommended to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, which if but truly obſerved might help us much in our caſe. You give it in your 5th Cauſe of Perſecution, Addreſs to <hi>Proteſtants Pages</hi> 241) it followes <hi>another rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon</hi> (of Perſecution) <hi>and that no ſmall one, is ſelfe-love and Impatiency of Men under contradiction, be it out of Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, that they are angry with what they cannot refute, or out of private Intereſt it matters not, their Opinion muſt Reign alone they are tenacious of their own ſenſe, and cannot endure to have it queſtioned, be there never ſo much reaſon for it, Men of theſe Paſſions are yet to learn, they are Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant of Religion by the want they have of Mortification, ſuch Perſons can eaſily let go their hold on Charity to lay violent hands upon their oppoſers if they have Power they rarely fail to uſe it ſo, not remembring, that when they abſolved them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves from the tye of Love, Meekneſs and Patience they have abandoned true Religion, and contend not for the Faith once delivered to the Saints which ſtood therein, but for meer words;</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>It is here that proud fleſh and a capricious head diſputes for Religion, and not an humble heart, and Divine frame of Spirit. Men that are angry for God, Paſſionate for Chriſt, and that call Names for Religion and ſlings Stones and Perſecute for Faith, may tell us they are Chriſtians if they will, but no body would know them to be ſuch by their fruits; to be ſure they are no Chriſtians of Chriſts making, I would to
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:98376:42"/>God the diſputants of our time did but calmly weigh the Irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligiouſneſs of their own heats for Religion, and ſee if what they contend for will quit the Coſt, will countervail the Charge of departing from Charity and making a Sacrifice for Peace to gain their Points; upon ſo ſeaſonable a reflection I am confident they would find that they rather ſhew their love to Opinion then truth, and ſeek Victory more then Concord.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Could men</hi> (Pray mind it) <hi>be contented, as he whom they call their Lord was, to declare their Meſſage and not ſtrive for Proſelites, nor vex for Conqueſt, they would recommend all to the Conſcience,</hi> and, <hi>if it muſt be ſo, patiently endure contradiction too, and ſo lay their Religion, as he did his, not in violence but in ſuffering. But I muſt freely profeſs, and in duty and Conſcience I do it, that I cannot call that Religion which is introduced againſt the Lawes of Love, Meekneſs and Friendſhip: Superſtition, intereſt or Faction I may. There is a Zeal without knowledge, that is Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtition, there is a Zeal againſt Knowledge, that is Intereſt or Faction, the true Hereſie; there is a Zeal with Knowledge that is Religion. Therefore blind Obedience may be Superſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, it can't be Religion, and if you will view the Countrys of Cruelty, you ſhall find them Superſtitious rather then Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious. Religion is gentle, it makes Men better, more friendly, loving, and Patient, then before, and the ſucceſs which followed Chriſtianity, while the Antient Profeſſors of it betook themſelves to no other defence, plainly proves the force of thoſe paſſive Arguments above all corporal puniſhments, and that we muſt never hope for the ſame Proſperity till we fall into the ſame Methods. Are Men Impatient of having their conceits owned? They are then moſt to be ſuſpected</hi> (pray mind it) <hi>Error and Superſtition, like crackt Titles, only fear to be ſearcht and run and cry for Authority and number. Truth is plain and ſtedfaſt without Arts or tricks; will you receive her, well; if not, there is no compulſion. But pray
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:98376:42"/>tell me, what is that deſired <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niformity that has not <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity, and that <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity which has not Love Meekneſs and Patience in it? I beſeech you hear me, for thoſe Men depart from the Spirit of Chriſtianity, that ſeek with Anger and Froward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to promote it. Let us not put ſo miſerable a Cheat upon our ſelves, nor ſuch an affront upon Chriſtianity, as to think that a moſt gentle and Patient Religion can be advanced by moſt ingentle and impatient wayes. I ſhould ſooner ſubmit to an humble Oppoſion, then to the greateſt Zealot in the World, and ſooner deliver my ſelf up to him that would modeſtly drop a Controverted truth, then to ſuch as ſeek tempeſtiouſly to carry it,</hi> &amp;c. I have quoted this largely, it is both ſo Chriſtian and pertinent to our purpoſe; for certainly you ought to practiſe what you have adviſed others to, for the little foxes are to be taken as well as the great one, and not only perſecution removed, as it ſtands in Corporal Puniſhments. but the ground of it: And certainly ſuch as are true Elders in Chriſt's Church will write after this Copy; and therefore 'tis impoſſible they ſhould ſtrive for their Opinion, no that is not the way into the Kingdom and patience of the Son of God. So that like their Lord and Maſter, if they have any Government, they take it by Patience and ſuffering; which as it is contrary to the Kingdom and Government of this World, ſo 'tis contrary to the nature, end and aim of all the carnal Profeſſions of Religion, but how Conform you are to the one and contrary to the other, is clear, by the Impoſing of your Opinions. For 'tis matter of fact, that the Impoſing of your Opinions contrary to what is above hath been the occaſion both of our disſatisfaction and diviſion; and pray what are theſe Opinions, but a Circumſtance and Ceremony: Now for you to indeavour to deſtroy the liberty of Examination on purpoſe that you may bring in your opinions, that are but as Circumſtance and Ceremony, this makes way for Lordſhip and Dominion, and that can
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:98376:43" rendition="simple:additions"/>not come in, but Ignorance and Slavery muſt follow. For not to Examine what we are to receive is to be Ignorant, but to be deprived of Choice is the Origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal of Slavery. Indeed if we muſt be inſlav'd after our Confeſſion to ſo much Freedom and underſtanding, Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance ſeems the beſt Medium to make us Patient to bear it; whiles to know and to be Impoſed upon muſt needs be grievous. In ſhort, there is nothing that can emonſtrate you more to be the Servants of Chriſt and that you truly honour him, then when like him, you can freely leave what you Propoſe to be Examin'd if true. But how much more ought you to avoid the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing of your Opinions: For if we muſt receive things becauſe you ſay it, and not becauſe we know them to be true; Our Building then like others will be on humane Authority, and not on the truth; and as nothing can more manifeſt you to be dead unto ſelf, and to the Rudiments and wayes of the World in this matter, and ſo alive unto God, then when you can freely leave what you bring to be examined; ſo nothing can more conduce to conſerve that honour we owe unto the Lord our Head, preſerve us a knowing and underſtanding People, and ſecure us from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Impoſed upon, then for us conſcienciouſly to reſerve and keep the Liberty of Examination. For once let that go through any confidence in Man and as the Reverance is Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicit, the Obedience is blind; 'tis no matter what Name of diſtinction thoſe Men go under, to whom we pay an Implicit Veneration; Ignorance and Slavery muſt follow: and where the effect is the ſame, the cauſe cannot differ in or about the <gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="1 word">

               </gap> of Men. When we conſider what you have wrote againſt Impoſition at divers times, and particularly in <hi>Addreſs</hi> to <hi>Proteſtants;</hi> the ſecond part being wholly to that purpoſe; what can thinking Men ſay, but that you ſhewed your parts well againſt Impoſition,
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:98376:43"/>as many had done before; but when you ſhould have giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en the Example unto the World, (which indeed they want in a Body of Men on a Religious ſcore,) and ſo have proved the truth of your Precepts or good Advice by your own Practiſe, here you fail'd and have been as difficient as others. So blind is ſelf, ſo partial is Intereſt, that Men cannot make the caſe of others their own; and therefore do not give what themſelves did but juſt now Inſiſt to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, not as a favour but as a right, and this hath blaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed all the Reformation to this day. It was not for no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing that <hi>Iſrael</hi> was commanded not to oppreſs Strangers; no certainly it ought to teach you to have been kind upon the account of Conſcience to Diſſenters, who had ſuffer'd your ſelves ſo much for the one, and pleaded ſo little for the other.</p>
            <p>Indeed had you but cordially made the caſe of other your own; and applyed unto your ſelves what you wrote to others, but in <hi>Addreſs</hi> to <hi>Proteſtants;</hi> it would have been needleſs to have inſerted any part of it here, becauſe you could not but have freely given unto your Brethren what you inſiſted to receive from others; and then we ſhould have had no difference, and that it is more bleſſed to give then to receive, as its greater to ſhew mercy then to receive it, is certainly true. But not doing this, but in ſtead of it to recriminate Perſons for ſeperateing, and for being disſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fyed is the occaſion that we have quoted <hi>Addreſs</hi> to <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants</hi> ſeveral times, and do yet further add ſome paſſages; the firſt is <hi>Pages</hi> 79 &amp; 80. where you ſay, <hi>to conclude, if ye deſire Peace, Love, Truth, ſeek Piety, and hate Hypocri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie, diſcard all thoſe things called Articles of Faith and Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nons of the Church, that are not to be found in expreſs terms of Scripture, or ſo plainly Authorized by Scripture, as may with eaſe be diſcerned by every honeſt and Conſcientious Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon; and in room of numerous and diſputed Opinions made
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:98376:44"/>the bonds of external communion, leſt ſome plain general and neceſſary truths be laid down, and let them be few.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Was it right in thoſe you wrote too, to take away thoſe things? And is it not wrong in you to impoſe ſuch things as give Occaſion? And if it was juſt and right in them to take theirs away, is it not right in you to take yours away? There is nothing but ſelf-love that can hinder, For it will hold as true in our caſe, being nothing but the Old Cauſe new Varniſht. But to go on (in <hi>Addreſs</hi> to <hi>Proteſtants</hi> 85 <hi>Page</hi>) you tell us, that <hi>the belief of Jeſus of</hi> Nazereth <hi>to be the Meſſiah, the Son and Chriſt of God, ſent to reſtore and ſave Mankind, is the firſt, and was then the only re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſit Article of Faith, without any large confeſſions, or a heap of Principles and Opinions,</hi> &amp;c. And you proceed to prove this confeſſion truly made to be ſufficient for Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion, and to that end alſo anſwer all the uſual Objections <hi>Page</hi> 91 and 92; the laſt Objection is this, ſay you, <hi>if it be alledged that this will take in all Parties, yee that Schiſma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks and Hereticks will creep in under this Confeſſion, ſince few of them will refuſe to make it;</hi> to this you anſwer, <hi>I do ſay</hi> (ſayes the Author) <hi>'twould be an happy day, what Man loves God and Chriſt, ſeeks Peace and concord, that would not rejoyce if all our Animoſities and vexations about mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of Religion were buryed in this one Confeſſion of Jeſus the great Author and Lord of the Chriſtian Religion, ſo often loſt in pretending to conteſt for it?</hi> O Friends! Have not you been greatly wanting to the World here in an exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple to your Brethren? whom you acknowledge to be one with you in the Worſhip and Doctrine of Truth, and therefore can never want thoſe requeſit Articles for Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion. O that you could ſee in this your day of tryal the things that belong to your Peace! Now that you may not think much that we ſhould thus remind you, becauſe
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:98376:44"/>we are to examine what we are to receive, we will take notice of a little part that you have quoted out of <hi>Jacobus Auntius</hi> to ſtrengthen what you there write, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ought to be of more force to conclude you.

               </gap>n with him in the 157 <hi>Page</hi> and continue to the 172 to the ſame purpoſe; but the Place we note is in 162 and followes thus <hi>and becauſe a thing will be ſo much the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter preſerved, by how much the greater is the Number of thoſe that keep it, the People oughe often to be put in mind that both the Reading of the Scriptures and the care of Religion belong, nor to the Paſtors of the Church only.</hi> (that is in our caſe not to the Preachers and Elders only) <hi>but that every one that would be ſaved</hi> (Pray mark it) <hi>ought to make dilli, gent ſearch whether corruption be all ready or</hi> (mind it) <hi>is for the future like to be introduced, and</hi> (mark) <hi>this to do no leſs carefully than if he was perſwaded that all beſides him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe was aſleep,</hi> (no fear then or hazzard of being ſingular) <hi>and</hi> (mind) <hi>whatſoever is wont to take off the Common People</hi> (that is ſuch as are neither Elders nor Paſtors) <hi>from ſuch ſtud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, care muſt be taken that that shing</hi> (obſerve) <hi>be wholly taken away.</hi> And pray who muſt take this away in our caſe but the Preachers and Elders? And how muſt they take it away but by letting every one know that is neither Preachers nor Elders, that if they expect to be ſaved, the care of Religion belongs to them as well as it doth to the Preachers and Elders, and therefore they ought to examine things and not to believe them true only becauſe ſuch as eſteem themſelves Paſtors and Elders ſay it; but becauſe they themſelves know they are true. And we are ſure if this will hold any where it will hold in our caſe; where we confeſs but one Lord and Head. But allas! Inſtead of this good Method to take away what hurts Examination, you are endeavouring all you can to eſtabliſh and confirm what you ought to take away, telling us, <hi>thoſe things do
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:98376:45"/>not belong to Faith Conſcience and Religion,</hi> and ſo not to us to Examine that are to be govern'd and rul'd, but to you that are our Elders and Teachers; for that is the Natural Conſequence of this great ſtrife for your Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions. But as what is above proves we ought to Examine things and that ſtrictly, ſo what followes confirms that we ought to have a choiſe as well as Examination. For in <hi>Page</hi> 149 it followes, <hi>to check this exhorbitancy the Apoſtle</hi> Paul <hi>demands, Who art thou that Judgeſt anothers Servant? To his own Lord he ſtands or falls; which ſhewes with great evidence</hi> (ſay you) <hi>that Chriſtians of all ſorts great and ſmall, are but Brethren (to be ſure) and conſequently</hi> (Pray mark) <hi>all Supe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riority, Lordſhip, and Impoſition are excluded (to be ſure.) But if there be a difference (among Chriſtians) 'tis in this, that as Chriſt taught, he that is greateſt is to be Servant to the reſt;</hi> (but ſay you) <hi>what is more oppoſice to a Servant then a Lord? And to Service then Injunction, and that on Penalties too? Here it is that Chriſt is only Lord and Lawgiver, who is only King of this inward Kingdom of the Soul; and 'tis to be noted</hi> (obſerve) <hi>that the Apoſtle did not write this to a private Brother, or in ſome ſpecial caſe, but to the Church</hi> (obſerve) <hi>as a general ſtanding truth and therefore</hi> (ſay you) <hi>now as au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thentick and proper as then; and if this be true, I cannot ſee</hi> (ſayes our Author) <hi>how any or even the moſt part of the Church</hi> (obſerve for it is patt to our caſe,) <hi>that are ſtill but Brethren to the reſt, of one Voluntary Communion and Profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, can with any ſhew of reaſon Impoſe upon them</hi> (of the ſame Community) <hi>and eſcape the reproof of this Scripture.</hi> (and pray mind, to confirm all this what followes) <hi>for</hi> (ſayes our Author) <hi>all Societies are to govern themſelves ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to their Inſtitution and firſt Principles of union; where there is violence on this part, Tyrany and not Order is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduced; Now ſince Perſwaſion and Conviction began all true Chriſtian Societies,</hi> (and therefore ours to be ſure in your ſenſe)
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:98376:45" rendition="simple:additions"/>
               <hi>all Chriſtian Societies muſt uphold themſelves upon the ſame free bottom</hi> (to be ſure) <hi>or they turn Antichriſtian, I beſeech you</hi> (ſayes the Author) <hi>here let us Examine our ſelves faithfully,</hi> indeed that is it we would be at, and the want of that is the cauſe of our Miſery,) <hi>and I am of belief</hi> (ſayes the Author) <hi>that ſomething will appear amongſt us, that ſhews great Reverence to that free Name.</hi> What do you ſay will not all this hold you? Can any thing be more to the purpoſe againſt Impoſition, or more pertinant to our caſe? Seeing 'tis Impoſition that excluded Us the ſame Society <gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="1 span">
                  <desc>〈…〉</desc>
               </gap>; and ought any thing to be more conſidered and vallued as Obligeing then what you have ſaid your ſelves? And yet that you have Impoſed your Opinions upon your Brethren is matter of Fact, truly not to be as good as your word in ſo Sollemn an Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion leſſens your Credit, as well as 'tis a diſhonour to God, being unrighteous in it ſelf. What you can ſay to come off, we do not know; except you will indea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to Improve this new diſtinction, that you have made; that is, that thoſe are Civil things and not Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious. But we have ſhewed that diſtinction to be danger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous in our Caſe alone; and here will a little Examine the difference betwixt your Plea for Impoſition, and thoſe you reprehend. You ſay <hi>ſuch have made Opinions Articles of Faith, and thoſe Articles of Faith terms of Communion;</hi> now to avoid this rock on which they ſplit, you will not make your Opinions Articles of Faith: No, for <hi>they do not concern Faith,</hi> You ſay; but ſtill you will make them terms of External Communion, and pray where's the difference? Sure 'tis only in Name; for the Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence and effect is the ſame, to witt, <hi>Disſatisfaction and Diviſion.</hi> Indeed if there is any difference, your way of making the difference is the worſe of the two, as not having ſo much to plead for it, as thoſe may have that
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:98376:46"/>you reprehend. As thus, they might believe what they did was right, and ſo might plead Conſcience for making Opinions Articles of Faith, and then them Articles Terms of Communion, though miſtaken. But you can not plead Conſcience for Impoſing your Opinions, while you do again and again ſay, they do not concern Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience. But take Notice, no Impoſition can be Juſt, where Conſcience cannot be pleaded, and Conſcience in this Caſe (generally ſpeaking) can never be truly plead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, but where Perſons goes into a known evil or neglect a known Duty; which can never be made out in your caſe againſt your Brethren; but further in this paſſage you tell us <hi>that Conſcience is allowed us.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Your words is Suſpicious, as well as dangerous; <hi>For who can diſpence with Conſcience but he that is Lord of Conſcience?</hi> But if you intend <hi>that Conſcience is unconcern'd,</hi> as the following words may Import; then does this prove what is above, that you cannot plead Conſcience for Impoſing upon your Brethren in thoſe things. And pray then what can you plead for Impoſing but your Will and Power? But laſtly you bid us, <hi>(the Viſible ground of Diſtance being ſo ſmall,) weigh with our ſelves by what has been, what may the conſequence of this lamentable breach.</hi> Muſt this affect us and not you, whiles we tell you that Conſcience is concerned; and you tell us it is not? Does this beſpeak you Conſciencious? No verily, this rather beſpeaks that you have loſt the tenderneſs of Conſcience, that thus ſeek to baffle Conſcience to pleaſe you. For once ſacrifice that, and farewel true Religion. But go too, is the Point little for us to comply with, and great for you to omitt? What ſay you, is not that a kind of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction? And where ſhall we find this unreaſonable Language moſt in uſe but amongſt the Impoſers of Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:98376:46"/>and Ceremonies? Which certainly you ought to Note; if it were but to avoid their company. But is the matter little indeed, and did you introduce this to fit us for greater things, or did you by this intend to Number the People that you might know the greatneſs of your ſtrength and largeneſs of your Dominion by the Subjection of the People? If that was it we cannot hope for a redreſs: For that would be to loſe the deſign and end. But if it was for the good of the People, as we ſuppoſe you will pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend, then ſeeing a contrary effect is brought forth, that is, in ſtead of Love and good will, <hi>(the effect of true Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,)</hi> Strife, Debate, and Diviſion ariſes; can you do any leſs for the cure of this evil, which hath attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the impoſing of your Opinions, then make your Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions indifferent? And what harm can there be in this? For your Brethren to do their buſineſs without Womens Meeting for Government, whiles you acknowledge <hi>they own the end, and are one in Judgement with you in the Worſhip and Doctrine of truth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>We doe ſincerely beſeech you ſeriouſly to conſider of theſe things, for your own good, for our Peace, and for the glory of God, and true Religion, <hi>that brings forth Peace on Earth, good will to Men and glory to God on high.</hi> For we can ſay in truth what we have writ is not for Contention, but for Peace, not for deſtruction, but for Information, and therein for Edification. We are not Ignorant, but what we have Writ may be controverted by ſuch as are not willing to make the beſt of things, and take things in the beſt ſenſe. For what Writing can eſcape a Cavilling Mind? Since 'tis clear that the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture (if it were Mens Intreſt) might be ſet at odds. Nay we ſee that one and the ſame word has different meanings given to it, by different apprehenſions of Men; then how
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:98376:47" rendition="simple:additions"/>much more ſo large a diſcourſe as this conſidering the things ſpoken of in it? However that we may avoid that danger all we can, we will endeavour to bring our pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent difference into as little compaſs as we can; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore as we have ſeveral times upon occaſion ſtated the matter in this Book, ſo we do it now that you may take the better Notice of it at parting. Therefore we do ſay again, <hi>There muſt be a neceſſity for that thing, that is brought in againſt your Brethrens conſent, or otherwiſe you muſt ſet forth that you have a right under the Notion of Elderſhip to bring in and Impoſe upon us, that which in truth there is no neceſſity for.</hi> You ſee we deny both, and have given our reaſons for it: And therefore if you can <gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="1 span">

               </gap> prove neither of thoſe Points, and yet will not make your Opinions indifferent; then we muſt ſay, <hi>that our Disſatisfaction is right, and Seperation on this account for quietneſs is really Juſt; and that all this noiſe that is made againſt Disſatisfaction and Diviſion, is but to cover an ill Cauſe, and therefore is as the ſmoak of the bottomleſs Pit: Which darkens the Sun and Air, that things cannot be yet ſeen as they are;</hi> but this will off; for the Sun will break through all thoſe Clouds and Diſipate thoſe Miſty Foggs.
